Fraser for Respondent. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*318</span></p>\n<p> Thompson, J.</p>\n<p> The plaintiff recovered a judgment of $1500 against East Lake School District, as damages for a broken leg sustained as the result of the negligence of a school teacher who had charge of the playgrounds. The plaintiff was run down by a pupil who was permitted to ride his bicycle among the children while they were engaged in playing a game during the recess period. From that judgment this appeal was perfected.</p>\n<p> The plaintiff, who was seven years of age, was attending the public school of the defendant district in Lake County. She was a pupil in the third grade of that school. As a part of the athletic training required, she was engaged, with other young pupils during the recess period, in playing a game called \"kick-the-can\". They were playing on the school grounds under the supervision of a teacher by the name of Anna Hull, who was then present within sight of the pupils. Without objection on the part of Miss Hull, two boys were permitted to ride their bicycles about the playground where the game was being conducted. With the knowledge of the teacher, and without protest on the part of the school district or its officers or employees, the boys had been permitted to ride their bicycles on and about the playgrounds while physical training and the games were being conducted for several months prior to the time of the accident. Without warning a boy by the name of Bob Nylander suddenly ran his bicycle against and over the plaintiff breaking her leg and seriously injuring her. In this suit for damages, the court, sitting without a jury, adopted findings to the effect that plaintiff was injured as the proximate result of the negligence of the defendant and its teacher, Anna Hull, and rendered judgment against the school district pursuant to section 2.801 of the School Code. From that judgment this appeal was perfected.</p>\n<p> The appellant contends that neither the pleadings, the findings nor the judgment are supported by the evidence; that the general demurrer to the complaint should have been sustained; and that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, which bars her right of recovery.</p>\n<p> [1] The demurrer was properly overruled. The complaint states a good cause of action against the defendant for the negligence of its teacher and supervisor of physical training and sports of the pupils while she was in charge of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*319</span> playgrounds during the period of recess. The complaint alleges that Anna Hull was the duly appointed and acting teacher of the school in actual charge and supervision of the physical training and games which were being conducted on the playgrounds at the time of the accident; that without protest, and with full knowledge of the dangers incident thereto, the boys were permitted by the teacher to ride their bicycles among the children upon the playgrounds while those exercises were being conducted; that while the plaintiff, with other children, was engaged in playing the game of \"kick-the-can\", without warning a pupil by the name of Bob Nylander ran his bicycle against and over the plaintiff, knocking her down and breaking her leg, and that her injuries were sustained as a direct result of the \"carelessness and negligence of the said defendant, its agents and employees, in compelling the said Donna May Buzzard to play a game in a dangerous and unsafe place on the school-grounds, and while under the supervision and direction of the said defendant, its agents and employees\".</p>\n<p> [2] It is contended there is a fatal variance between the allegations of the complaint and the proof adduced; that the negligence alleged consists of injuries received by the plaintiff while she was playing a game which she was \"compelled\" to participate in, and the uncontradicted evidence shows that she was voluntarily playing the game of \"kick-the-can\" at the time she was injured. The demurrer was general in its form. There was no specification of uncertainty in the allegations of the complaint. Paragraph VI of the complaint specifically alleges that the plaintiff was compelled to play the game \"in a dangerous and unsafe place and in the presence of Anna Hull\". Paragraph VIII alleges that the plaintiff was injured as a result of the negligence of the defendant in compelling the plaintiff to play the game \"in a dangerous and unsafe place\". It is immaterial whether the plaintiff was actually compelled to play the game of \"kick-the-can\", or that she was injured while voluntarily playing that game as a part of her recess recreation, for the accident occurred on the school playgrounds during the period of recess while the pupils were under the personal supervision of the teacher. Section 5.543 of the School Code provides in that regard: <span class=\"star-pagination\">*320</span></p>\n<p> \"Every teacher in the public schools must hold pupils to a strict account for their conduct on the way to and from school, on the playgrounds or during recess.\"</p>\n<p> Among the \"Duties of Principals and Teachers\" required by the State Board of Education, found in section III, subdivision \"D\" of the School Code of California in 1929, is the following provision:</p>\n<p> \"Where special playground supervision is not provided, teachers shall supervise the conduct and direct the play of the pupils of their classes in the school or on the schoolgrounds during the intermissions and before and after school. ...\"</p>\n<p> A fair construction of the allegation of the complaint, in the absence of a special demurrer for uncertainty, is that the defendant failed to maintain a safe condition of the playgrounds by neglecting to prohibit the riding of bicycles among the children thereon while they were engaged in playing games. We are of the opinion the demurrer was properly overruled.</p>\n<p> [3] The findings and judgments are adequately supported by the evidence. It was the duty of the teacher, Miss Hull, to regulate the conduct of pupils in their sports on the playground during the periods of recess. We are of the opinion it constituted negligence to permit pupils to ride bicycles about the playground among the children while they were engaged in playing games under the circumstances of this case. The teacher knew that the boys had been in the habit of doing so for several months prior to the time of the accident. She saw them riding their bicycles among the children where they were playing the game of \"kick-the-can\", on the occasion just prior to the accident. No effort was made to stop that dangerous practice.</p>\n<p> [4] Under the provisions of section 2.801 of the School Code, as it existed at the time of the accident which is involved in this litigation, public school districts are liable for damages \"on account of injury to persons or property arising because of the negligence of the district, or its officers or employees\". It was not then necessary for a verified claim for such damages to have been filed with the clerk of the board as a prerequisite for maintaining the action. The amendment of that section requiring a verified claim for damages to filed within ninety days after the accident <span class=\"star-pagination\">*321</span> occurs did not become effective until August 27, 1937. (Stats. 1937, page 414.)</p>\n<p> The findings and judgment are adequately supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p> The evidence shows without dispute that Miss Hull was present, standing within fifty feet of the place where the accident occurred, and that she then had supervision of the pupils in their physical education and in the playing of games; that she actually saw Bob Nylander and another boy riding their bicycles within a few feet of the place where Donna May Buzzard and the other children were engaged in playing the game of \"kick-the-can\"; that she actually knew of their riding their bicycles about the playgrounds during the playing of games ever since Christmas, which was two and a half months prior to the time of the accident, and that while they were forbidden from riding \"in front of the school or around the corners,\" they were not instructed to refrain from riding among the children on the playground.</p>\n<p> It has been held that a school district is liable for damages for injuries sustained by a pupil on account of the negligence of its teachers and agents, resulting from the use of defective and dangerous machinery, equipment, explosive chemicals, or improper supervision of the playgrounds. (Bellman v. San Francisco High School Dist., 11 Cal.2d 576 [81 PaCal.2d 894]; Taylor v. Oakland High School Dist., 12 Cal.2d 310 [83 PaCal.2d 948]; 23 Cal.Jur. 109, sec. 76, 10 Cal.Jur. 10-year Supp. 237, secs. 77 d-i.) Regarding the question of negligence, the Supreme Court said in the Bellman case, supra:</p>\n<p> \"The question is whether the school officials used the same care as persons of ordinary prudence, charged with the duty of carrying on the public school system, would use under the same circumstances. ... What is ordinary care depends upon the circumstances of each particular case and is to be determined as a fact with reference to the situation and knowledge of the parties.\"</p>\n<p> In the Taylor case, supra, it was held to be negligent for the district to permit a garbage truck to drive upon the school grounds without proper restrictions when that conduct results in injuries to a pupil thereon.</p>\n<p> In support of its assertion that the defendant is not liable for negligence in failing to prohibit the riding of bicycles among the pupils on the playground under the circumstances <span class=\"star-pagination\">*322</span> of this case, the following cases are relied upon: Weldy v. Oakland High School Dist., 19 Cal.App.2d 429 [65 PaCal.2d 851], Goodman v. Pasadena City High School Dist., 4 Cal.App.2d 65 [40 PaCal.2d 854], Kerby v. Elk Grove Union High School Dist., 1 Cal.App.2d 246 [36 PaCal.2d 431, 94 A.L.R. 1502], McCloy v. Huntington Park Union High School Dist., 139 Cal.App. 237 [33 PaCal.2d 882], Underhill v. Alameda Elementary School Dist., 133 Cal.App. 733 [24 PaCal.2d 849], Hack v. Sacramento City Junior College Dist., 131 Cal.App. 444 [21 PaCal.2d 477], and Ellis v. Burns Valley School Dist., 128 Cal.App. 550 [18 PaCal.2d 79].</p>\n<p> There is nothing in these cases at variance with what we have previously said regarding the negligence of the defendant in this case for failure to properly supervise pupils on the playgrounds of the school prohibiting students from riding bicycles among the children while they are engaged in playing games. Each of the cases relied on by the appellant was properly determined upon the particular facts involved therein. They may be readily distinguished from the circumstances upon which the present case was decided. Most of the last cited cases were founded on claims for injuries sustained by pupils on account of the conduct of other students engaged in playing games on the school premises, over which the supervisors of sports had no control, and which acts could not have been reasonably anticipated. None of those cases present accidents which were the result of negligent omissions to regulate the conduct of pupils on the playgrounds with respect to known acts or practice of pupils from which, by the exercise of reasonable prudence the school authorities should have anticipated that injuries were likely to follow.</p>\n<p> There is no evidence that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. That was an issue for the determination of the trial court. There is an abundance of evidence to support the finding that she was free from contributory negligence.</p>\n<p> The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p> Tuttle, J., and Pullen, P.

Nourse, Deputy Attorney-General, for Respondent.</p>\n<p> White, J.</p>\n<p> By respective counts in an information filed against him, appellant was accused jointly with one Robert K. West of two charges of forgery and one charge of grand theft. Appellant admitted the commission of two prior felonies, as alleged in the information, and also admitted the service of penitentiary sentences therefor. Following a jury trial resulting in the conviction of both defendants on all <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> counts and the pronouncement of judgment, defendant Rinehart alone prosecutes this appeal.</p>\n<p> Epitomizing the facts most favorable to the prosecution, as we are required to do when the verdict is against appellant, we find in the record testimony that on the evening of October 31, 1938, appellant and his wife appeared in a radio store in the city of Los Angeles, where they examined two radios of different makes and discussed the relative merits thereof with a salesman, George Myers. Appellant favored one type of radio, while his wife preferred the other model. After about an hour's discussion with the salesman, appellant and his wife departed, appellant remarking, \"We always think it over and we will let you know.\" On the afternoon of November 5, about 2 o'clock, appellant reappeared at the radio store, at this time accompanied by his codefendant, West, whom he introduced to the salesman as his brother-in-law. There was further discussion concerning the two radios, and the salesman finally offered to sell either machine for $213, with a down payment of $75. Appellant requested that both radios be sent to his home on approval, so that his wife might have a further opportunity to compare the two models. He suggested that delivery be made at 8 o'clock that evening, but the salesman objected, saying that it was impossible to make delivery after 5 o'clock that afternoon. Both defendants then left the store for the ostensible purpose of communicating with appellant's wife regarding the possibility of accepting delivery at an earlier hour. The evidence indicates, however, that they proceeded to 2048 West Seventy-fourth Street in Los Angeles, arriving there about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. They had previously inspected the house next door, at 2042 West Seventy-fourth Street, with a view toward renting the premises. On that occasion they met Miss Barbara Mae Crawford at the first-named address and told her they desired to rent the last-mentioned house immediately. Miss Crawford explained that she had no authority to rent the house, and that her mother was in complete charge of such matters. Appellant, however, represented that they had some furniture in storage which had to be out by 5 o'clock, and prevailed upon the daughter to rent the house immediately, subject to her mother's approval. Appellant thereupon, in the presence of Miss Crawford, wrote out the check described in count III, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> signing thereto the fictitious name \"E. A. Mason\", and handed the check to her.</p>\n<p> Having obtained possession of the key, appellant called Mr. Myers, the radio salesman, on the telephone, and directed him to send the radios to 2042 West Seventy-fourth Street. In response to a question by the radio salesman, appellant represented that he owned the furniture at the last-named address, which house he had rented completely furnished. In addition, appellant promised to make the agreed down payment that day; to sign a contract for the payment of the balance of the purchase price on the following Monday, and to return one of the radios at the same time. The radios were delivered at the Seventy-fourth Street address between 4:30 and 5 o'clock on Saturday afternoon. Appellant was not present when the delivery was made, but his codefendant accepted the radios, signing the delivery slip with the name \"B. Raleigh\". The same defendant also handed to Sam Slyman, one of the deliverymen who made the delivery for the radio firm, a check in the sum of $75, bearing the fictitious signature \"E. A. Mason\". Count II of the information is based upon the issuance of this check.</p>\n<p> Shortly thereafter appellant returned to the house. Between 5:30 and 6 o'clock the defendants had some conversation with Mrs. A. S. Crawford, mother of Miss Barbara Mae Crawford, regarding the rental of the premises. About 6 o'clock they loaded the radios into an automobile belonging to defendant West and took one of the radios to appellant's home, delivering the other to defendant West's home. Appellant was arrested November 17th, and his codefendant, West, was taken into custody the following day. One of the radios was found in West's home and the other in his garage.</p>\n<p> Appellant offered no evidence in his defense, nor did he himself take the witness stand to deny any of the foregoing facts, many of which were established by the testimony of his codefendant when the latter was a witness in his own behalf.</p>\n<p> [1] Appellant first urges the point that in permitting the single information to charge him with both the crimes of grand theft and forgery, the trial court committed error which was prejudicial to the substantial rights of appellant and violative of the provisions of section 954 of the Penal Code. This claim is without merit. The cited section authorizes the charging of two or more different offenses in the same <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> information when the different offenses are \"connected together in their commission\". The evidence herein narrated clearly and conclusively shows not only that the three offenses charged were closely connected in their commission, but that the fictitious checks constituting the forgery charges were issued to facilitate the commission of the grand theft. (People v. Holmes, 130 Cal.App. 507, 509 [20 PaCal.2d 67].) The three counts were properly joined. The case of People v. Frank, 130 Cal.App. 212 [19 PaCal.2d 850], relied upon by appellant, has no application to the facts of the instant case.</p>\n<p> [2] It is next contended by appellant that the evidence is insufficient to support the guilty verdicts for the reason that the record is barren of any evidence to show that appellant either signed or uttered any of the checks. Recourse to the record, however, indicates that the witness Barbara Mae Crawford testified positively and directly that appellant in her presence wrote, signed and delivered to her one of the checks. Her testimony in this regard was corroborated by appellant's codefendant; and a handwriting expert, whose qualifications were stipulated, testified that in his opinion both checks were written by the same hand. Appellant did not himself deny, or offer any testimony in contravention of, the foregoing.</p>\n<p> [3] Appellant also urges insufficiency of the evidence for the reason, as stated by him, \"No evidence has been introduced by the prosecution to establish venue.\" This claim is untenable. For example, there is evidence that both checks were drawn on a Los Angeles city bank; that one of them was written in that city; that the radio store was located in the same city; and these were all circumstances not to be ignored. Without going into further detail, suffice it to say that the evidence unerringly and logically points to the single inference that the crimes were committed in Los Angeles County. Under the facts of this case the jury were justified in concluding, as jurors, what they well knew as men and women, that the streets named by some of the witnesses meant certain well known and so named streets in the City of and County of Los Angeles. (People v. McGregar, 88 Cal. 140, 143 [26 P. 97].) Furthermore, as was said by this court in People v. Carter, 10 Cal.App.2d 387, 389 [52 PaCal.2d 294], \"The state gives no assurance to its feloniously insubordinate citizens that the venue of their crimes will be fixed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> beyond a reasonable doubt; that doctrine applies only to the issue of guilt. (People v. McGill, 10 Cal.App.2d 155 [51 PaCal.2d 433]; Underhill on Criminal Evidence, vol. 1, sec. 36, p. 45.) The defendant and appellant, therefore, is in no position to complain because the location of the offense was not established to a degree of certainty more to his liking.\"</p>\n<p> [4] Appellant next asserts that since one of the checks was not presented for payment and that no damage or injury resulted from its issuance, that the crime of forgery predicated upon such check was not proven. In a prosecution for forgery it is not required that actual damage ensue; it is sufficient to show, as was done in the case at bar, that the instrument was prepared with the intent to deceive and defraud another. (People v. Turner, 113 Cal. 278 [45 P. 331]; People v. Baender, 68 Cal.App. 49, 59 [228 P. 536]; People v. Kuhn, 33 Cal.App. 319 [165 P. 26].) In Henderson v. State, 14 Tex. 503, it was said:</p>\n<p> \"The intent to defraud, it is true, is of the essence of the crime. But it is not essential that any person be actually defrauded, or that any act be done toward the attainment of the fruits of the crime other than the making of the instrument. And the very fact of the forgery itself will be sufficient to imply an intention to defraud; or at least it will be sufficient if, from the circumstances of the case, the jury can fairly infer that it was the intention of the party to utter the forged instrument (3 Greenleaf on Evidence, sec. 103; 3 Archibald on Criminal Pleading, 546; 2 Russell on Crimes, 361 [7th Am. from 3d London ed.]), and a fortiori if, as in this case, there is proof that he did utter it. It is well settled, it is true, as held in a case cited by counsel (People v. Shall, 9 Cow. (N.Y.) 788), that the foregoing of an instrument which on its face is void is not indictable. But that is not this case. The deed on its face appears to be a valid, legal conveyance of land. And it is sufficient that it is such a character of instrument that the consequences of the forgery would necessarily or possibly be to defraud some person. It is sufficient if it appear that by possibility either the state or some person might be defrauded. (Act above cited; 3 Greenleaf on Evidence, sec. 103; 2 Russell on Crimes, 361, note; 2 N. J. 212.)\"</p>\n<p> That the spurious checks here in question did actually deceive George Myers, the radio salesman, and Barbara Mae <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> Crawford, who rented to appellant and his codefendant the house to which delivery of the radios was made, is obvious.</p>\n<p> [5] Finally, appellant earnestly insists that the court committed prejudicial error during the trial of the case by admitting in evidence certain statements and confessions purported to have been made to one of the police officers by appellant; the objection being that they were not freely and voluntarily made. The record indicates that appellant made two statements to the officers. On the first occasion appellant stated that he knew why he had been arrested and that he knew where the radios were; but he declined to say where the radios could be found. The second conversation took place in the presence of appellant, his wife, and the officer, at which time the officer threatened to arrest appellant's wife as an accomplice unless appellant agreed to disclose where the property could be found. Thereupon appellant furnished the requested information. There is no claim of any threat or intimidation at the time appellant made the first and only really incriminating statement to the effect that he was aware of the reason for his arrest and that he had knowledge of the location of the stolen property. In connection with the second statement, if there be any doubt as to the voluntary nature thereof, the conversation was nevertheless properly admitted. Whatever of an incriminatory nature there might be in the last made statement to the officer, nowhere in it did appellant admit that he either stole the radios or issued or uttered the fictitious checks in question. A statement or an admission which amounts to less than a confession is admissible without the necessity of showing the absence of promises, inducements or coercion. (People v. Leroy, 65 Cal. 613 [4 P. 649]; People v. Johnson, 203 Cal. 153, 164 [263 P. 524].) Where, as here, appellant admitted facts that did not amount to a confession, but which when connected with other facts tended to prove his guilt, the rule is not altered. Proof of such admissions is competent without preliminary proof. (People v. Ammerman, 118 Cal. 23, 32 [50 P. 15].)</p>\n<p> The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p> York, P.

Nourse, Deputy Attorney-General, for Respondent.</p>\n<p> White, J.</p>\n<p> By respective counts in an information filed against him, appellant was accused jointly with one Robert K. West of two charges of forgery and one charge of grand theft. Appellant admitted the commission of two prior felonies, as alleged in the information, and also admitted the service of penitentiary sentences therefor. Following a jury trial resulting in the conviction of both defendants on all <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> counts and the pronouncement of judgment, defendant Rinehart alone prosecutes this appeal.</p>\n<p> Epitomizing the facts most favorable to the prosecution, as we are required to do when the verdict is against appellant, we find in the record testimony that on the evening of October 31, 1938, appellant and his wife appeared in a radio store in the city of Los Angeles, where they examined two radios of different makes and discussed the relative merits thereof with a salesman, George Myers. Appellant favored one type of radio, while his wife preferred the other model. After about an hour's discussion with the salesman, appellant and his wife departed, appellant remarking, \"We always think it over and we will let you know.\" On the afternoon of November 5, about 2 o'clock, appellant reappeared at the radio store, at this time accompanied by his codefendant, West, whom he introduced to the salesman as his brother-in-law. There was further discussion concerning the two radios, and the salesman finally offered to sell either machine for $213, with a down payment of $75. Appellant requested that both radios be sent to his home on approval, so that his wife might have a further opportunity to compare the two models. He suggested that delivery be made at 8 o'clock that evening, but the salesman objected, saying that it was impossible to make delivery after 5 o'clock that afternoon. Both defendants then left the store for the ostensible purpose of communicating with appellant's wife regarding the possibility of accepting delivery at an earlier hour. The evidence indicates, however, that they proceeded to 2048 West Seventy-fourth Street in Los Angeles, arriving there about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. They had previously inspected the house next door, at 2042 West Seventy-fourth Street, with a view toward renting the premises. On that occasion they met Miss Barbara Mae Crawford at the first-named address and told her they desired to rent the last-mentioned house immediately. Miss Crawford explained that she had no authority to rent the house, and that her mother was in complete charge of such matters. Appellant, however, represented that they had some furniture in storage which had to be out by 5 o'clock, and prevailed upon the daughter to rent the house immediately, subject to her mother's approval. Appellant thereupon, in the presence of Miss Crawford, wrote out the check described in count III, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> signing thereto the fictitious name \"E. A. Mason\", and handed the check to her.</p>\n<p> Having obtained possession of the key, appellant called Mr. Myers, the radio salesman, on the telephone, and directed him to send the radios to 2042 West Seventy-fourth Street. In response to a question by the radio salesman, appellant represented that he owned the furniture at the last-named address, which house he had rented completely furnished. In addition, appellant promised to make the agreed down payment that day; to sign a contract for the payment of the balance of the purchase price on the following Monday, and to return one of the radios at the same time. The radios were delivered at the Seventy-fourth Street address between 4:30 and 5 o'clock on Saturday afternoon. Appellant was not present when the delivery was made, but his codefendant accepted the radios, signing the delivery slip with the name \"B. Raleigh\". The same defendant also handed to Sam Slyman, one of the deliverymen who made the delivery for the radio firm, a check in the sum of $75, bearing the fictitious signature \"E. A. Mason\". Count II of the information is based upon the issuance of this check.</p>\n<p> Shortly thereafter appellant returned to the house. Between 5:30 and 6 o'clock the defendants had some conversation with Mrs. A. S. Crawford, mother of Miss Barbara Mae Crawford, regarding the rental of the premises. About 6 o'clock they loaded the radios into an automobile belonging to defendant West and took one of the radios to appellant's home, delivering the other to defendant West's home. Appellant was arrested November 17th, and his codefendant, West, was taken into custody the following day. One of the radios was found in West's home and the other in his garage.</p>\n<p> Appellant offered no evidence in his defense, nor did he himself take the witness stand to deny any of the foregoing facts, many of which were established by the testimony of his codefendant when the latter was a witness in his own behalf.</p>\n<p> [1] Appellant first urges the point that in permitting the single information to charge him with both the crimes of grand theft and forgery, the trial court committed error which was prejudicial to the substantial rights of appellant and violative of the provisions of section 954 of the Penal Code.

Heald, District Attorney (Imperial County), as Amicus Curiae, on Behalf of Respondent.</p>\n<p> Haines, J., pro tem.</p>\n<p> Defendant Kunishima was, during the year 1937, engaged in raising farm produce in Imperial County and appellant Manos claims to have been the assignee of Manos Brothers, to whom Kunishima in December of that year is said to have executed a promissory note for $4,000 and interest, secured by a crop mortgage on a tomato crop then growing on Kunishima's premises in that county, which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*369</span> mortgage is stated to have been in that month duly recorded. On July 12, 1938, respondent Takahashi commenced the instant action in the Superior Court of Imperial County against Kunishima to obtain judgment on certain labor claims aggregating $1,053, one of which Takahashi asserted to have been originally his own, and the other two of which he alleged that he had acquired by assignment. Pending this action he took out a writ of attachment and caused notice of garnishment thereunder to be served on the Consolidated Produce Co., Ltd., hereinafter referred to as the \"Produce Company\", a Los Angeles concern to which Kunishima had delivered the tomatoes. The Produce Company on July 15th made return in the words and figures following:</p>\n<p> \"To notice of garnishment and demand for a statement served on me this 15th day of July, A. D. 1938, by the sheriff of Los Angeles County, under and by virtue of a writ of attachment issued in the above entitled cause my answer is: That __________ I am indebted to __________, said defendant, in the sum of __________ Dollars, and that __________ I have __________ in __________ my possession __________ and under __________ my control __________ personal property belonging to said defendant, to-wit: No funds\"</p>\n<p> \"NOTE: Handled shipments for this account, but notified to effect by Manos Bros. of San Diego, California, they hold Crop Mortgage covering crops produced; and they rightfully entitled to proceeds and demanding payment thereon. Have therefore withheld payments until such a time as proper party proven rightfully entitled to these payments.\"</p>\n<p> \"Amount withheld $1140.91.\"</p>\n<p> Thereupon Takahashi filed in the case a petition, apparently conceived to be under the provisions of section 689 of the Code of Civil Procedure, claiming that the labor on which his claims were based had been bestowed on the crop delivered to the Produce Company and asking determination of the right to the money derived from the sale of the crop. The court directed a hearing on the matter and fixed August 24, 1938, as the time therefor, of which notice was given to the Produce Company but so far as appears to nobody else. In the meantime it enjoined the Produce Company from disbursing the $1140.91. Kunishima having defaulted in the main case, Takahashi proceeded to take judgment as he had prayed on July 26th, and on July 27th, he took out an execution thereon for $1,064 then due on the judgment, and had a notice <span class=\"star-pagination\">*370</span> of levy thereon served on the Produce Company which refused to pay the sheriff the funds in its hands but instead made return that it was not indebted to Kunishima and had in its possession or under its control no personal property belonging to him but did have in its possession $1140.91 as the sales price of produce consigned to it by Kunishima for sale but that Manos Brothers claimed such proceeds by virtue of a crop mortgage. On August 12th, Takahashi made an affidavit under section 717 of the Code of Civil Procedure asking that the Produce Company, Manos Brothers, and appellant George Manos appear and show cause why the money should not be paid to the sheriff. The court on that day issued an order to show cause accordingly, fixing August 24th as the time for the hearing on the matter, restraining the Produce Company in the meantime from doing anything to prejudice the proceeding and shortening to five days the time for service of the order. This order was served on all parties concerned but the service was not made on appellant until August 23d, and he apparently made no appearance on August 24th. The court minutes as of that date recite that \"Leave is granted to the plaintiff for a reference before Arthur W. Kennedy, attorney at law, on September 10, 1938, at 10 o'clock a. m.\"</p>\n<p> According to the recitals in the court's findings hereinafter referred to, the original petition filed for determination of the title to the property sought to be levied on under the writ of attachment, as well as the hearing asked for in the affidavit made under section 717 by way of a proceeding supplementary to execution, came on together before the court on August 24th, and were continued to August 31st, at which latter time Takahashi, Kunishima, Manos Brothers and appellant George Manos all did appear by counsel, and counsel for appellant George Manos, according to the recitals referred to in the findings, objected to the court's jurisdiction \"to determine the title to the property\" attached, and presented and sought leave to file a petition in intervention. This leave, however, the court denied.</p>\n<p> In this proposed petition in intervention appellant Manos set out the making of the note and crop mortgage by Kunishima in favor of Manos Brothers and the assignment of the same by Manos Brothers to him; that the tomatoes were subject to the mortgage lien; that the mortgage provided that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*371</span> the crop should be delivered into the mortgagee's possession for sale and the proceeds applied to the debt; that Kunishima, in violation of the terms of the mortgage and without notice to the mortgagee, had removed $1140.91 worth of tomatoes from the land and delivered the same to the Produce Company with instructions to sell them for his account; that the Produce Company had done so and realized therefrom $1140.91, which sum it held; that the case as between the respondent Takahashi and defendant Kunishima was collusive and instituted to defraud Manos and his assignors; that Kunishima was not in fact indebted to Takahashi; and that he, Manos, was entitled to the $1140.91.</p>\n<p> The hearing of August 31st was adjourned (according again to the recitals mentioned) for the taking of evidence in Los Angeles, pursuant to the reference made by the court, after which the court on October 25, 1938, rendered judgment for respondent Takahashi which, however, was vacated by consent and the matter reargued. Appellant claims that he was not represented at the taking of the evidence in Los Angeles and his counsel claim to have had no notice of the hearing there. The findings assert that they did have such notice thereof.</p>\n<p> The findings bear date December 17, 1938. They are of considerable length and, as we have stated, recite various proceedings above mentioned; undertake to determine that the claim of Manos Brothers and George Manos to a lien upon the funds in controversy by virtue of their crop mortgage is unsupported by the evidence, for the reason that on January 19, 1938, they filed an action in San Diego County, which was subsequently transferred to Imperial County, against Kunishima on the $4,000 promissory note and filed therein an attachment affidavit and secured the issuance of a writ of attachment and levy thereof on the said moneys in the possession of the Produce Company, whereby they waived their mortgage lien; further, that they waived it by reason of their apparent consent to Kunishima's sale of the crop and their lack of reasonable diligence in protecting their rights after the crop had been harvested. The court also found that by Takahashi's action in levying under his own writ of attachment on July 15, 1938, he obtained a prior lien on the money in the hands of the Produce Company and that he is entitled to satisfaction of his judgment therefrom. It was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*372</span> further found that the Produce Company had, prior to the making of said findings, filed an interpleader action in Imperial County wherein it named as defendants both Takahashi, Manos Brothers and George Manos, and had offered to deposit therein the sum of $1,064 with interest thereon from July 26, 1938, and costs, for disposition to whichever party should be adjudged entitled thereto, to which sums the court found, as above stated, that Takahashi was entitled.</p>\n<p> Pursuant to these findings and in accordance with certain conclusions of law drawn by it from them, the court thereupon proceeded in the instant case to adjudge Takahashi entitled to the money claimed by him, but to provide that upon the deposit by the Produce Company of the money in its hands with the county clerk of Imperial County, either in the instant case or in the interpleader action, such clerk should pay Takahashi therefrom enough to satisfy his judgment and hold the balance, if any, subject to the court's further order. It is from this judgment that the present appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p> The fundamental question in the present appeal appears to us to be whether, either under the provisions of sections 544, 545 and 689 of the Code of Civil Procedure, relating to proceedings to be taken in certain circumstances after an attachment levied on property in the hands of persons other than the immediate parties to the action, or under sections 717 to 720, both inclusive, of the Code of Civil Procedure, having to do with proceedings supplementary to execution, the court had any jurisdiction in the instant proceeding to make the determination complained of.</p>\n<p> [1] Section 544 deals with the circumstances under which third parties become liable to an attaching creditor, not with the matter of adjudicating their liability. It has been squarely held that \"neither that section nor section 545 authorizes the court or referee to make an adjudication as to the matter of the indebtedness of the garnishee to a party whose property is attached\". (Bunnell v. Wynns, 13 Cal.App.2d 114, 116 [56 PaCal.2d 267], hearing denied by Supreme Court.) [2] So far as section 689 is concerned, the proceeding there contemplated has to do only with the determination, after an attachment levy, of rights in the property levied upon asserted by a verified third party claim. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*373</span> The Produce Company's return to the notice of garnishment under the attachment was not verified, nor did it assert any beneficial interest on the part of the Produce Company in the funds sought to be attached. No authority whatever existed to try title under it. [3] Manifestly, therefore, if the judgment appealed from is to be sustained at all, it must be sustained as one authorized by sections 717 to 720, both inclusive. But it cannot be so sustained. It has long been settled that no jurisdiction exists under these sections to summarily try the question of whether the third party served with notice of an execution levy is indebted to the defendant when such an indebtedness is denied. (Parker v. Page, 38 Cal. 522; Hartman v. Olvera, 51 Cal. 501; Hibernia Sav. &amp; Loan Soc. v. Superior Court, 56 Cal. 265; Ex parte Hollis, 59 Cal. 405, 413, 414; G. Cavaglieri Mortgage Co. v. Superior Court, 79 Cal.App. 655 [250 P. 700].) So far as the right to enter any summary order for the payment of the funds is concerned, such denial is conclusive against the court's power to make it. (G. Cavaglieri Mortgage Co. v. Superior Court, supra.) The court can, in such a case, do no more, after holding the examination, than to authorize, under section 720, the institution of an independent action and forbid the disposition of the fund while that is going on. A fortiori do these principles apply where the one served with the notice of the levy not only denies the indebtedness to the defendant but, as here, asserts that the funds in his hands are in fact claimed by someone other than the defendant. (Deering &amp; Co. v. Richardson-Kimball Co., 109 Cal. 73, 82, 83 [41 P. 801]; Miller v. Superior Court, 82 Cal.App. 634, 639 [256 P. 431].)</p>\n<p> [4] Respondent claims that these authorities are not applicable because on the return to the original attachment levy the Produce Company did not deny but admitted an indebtedness to Kunishima. There is nothing whatever in this claim. It is sufficiently evident from the return, as set out in the record, that it was made on a form furnished by the sheriff containing inter alia the words: \"I am indebted to __________, said defendant, in the sum of __________ Dollars, and that __________ I have __________ in __________ my possession __________ and under __________ my control __________ personal property belonging to said defendant, to-wit:\" and that the assistant secretary of the Produce Company <span class=\"star-pagination\">*374</span> deemed that he had sufficiently negatived these solicited statements by writing after them the words \"No funds\" followed by the explanation under the heading \"NOTE\" hereinbefore in this opinion set out. When the return is looked at as a whole, no other construction of it appears reasonable. As respects the later return made to the execution levy, it is explicit in the denial that the Produce Company owed Kunishima anything. [5] It has been suggested that appellant, by appearing in connection with the proceedings actually taken in the instant case, waived his right to object to the court's jurisdiction to make adjudications therein. But the record shows that he objected to the jurisdiction so far at least as the attempt to try title under the attachment proceedings was concerned and, as respects the proceedings supplementary to execution in refusing him leave to file his petition in intervention, the court in effect denied him the right to raise issues which he would in the independent action contemplated by section 720 of the Code of Civil Procedure have been entitled to try, such inter alia as the bona fides of the indebtedness on which the respondent had obtained judgment. These were questions which he had the right to raise in a proper forum, for, unlike Kunishima, he was not estopped by the default judgment to raise them. (Coghill v. Marks, 29 Cal. 673; McEldowney v. Madden, 124 Cal. 108 [56 P. 783]; Carlin v. Masten, 118 Cal.App. 373 [5 PaCal.2d 65].) We agree, however, that a proceeding supplementary to execution was not a proper one in which to try these questions. By that token his rights ought not to have been concluded in a proceeding in which he could not properly raise them.</p>\n<p> In view of the situation as we have set it out and the authorities cited, we think it clear that the trial court erred in attempting, in the case before us, to make any adjudication determining the right to the money in the hands of the Produce Company. We are not especially interested, therefore, in the details of the evidence presented to it other than those which we have recited. What has been said is enough to show that it was without jurisdiction to act at all in deciding who was entitled to the funds levied upon. Whether it was right or wrong in the views entertained by it as to who was entitled to them is, therefore, a matter which does not greatly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*375</span> concern us now. It may be pointed out, however, that even were we entitled here to investigate that question, the record before us would not afford us the means of doing so. The briefs are full of assertions about what the evidence presented to the trial court showed and what it did not show, but counsel have furnished us with neither a reporter's transcript nor bill of exceptions to enable us to know anything more about the matter than is exhibited in what is tantamount to a judgment roll. We learn from the records that we do have, that the trial court had before it files in the other two cases referred to in its findings, that is, in the attachment action said to have been brought on the $4,000 note, and in the interpleader case. No copies of any of these files have been furnished us except as counsel undertake to quote from them in the briefs. In the amicus curiae brief filed by the district attorney, he quotes from the depositions said to have been taken in Los Angeles. This testimony is not before us.</p>\n<p> It is wholly outside the record brought up to us, but was stated at the oral argument before this court, that the Produce Company, whether before or after the actual rendition of the court's judgment here appealed from, in fact paid the funds to the county clerk of Imperial County, as a proceeding in the interpleader suit and not in the instant case, and that the court proceeded in that suit to enter a judgment exonerating it from all further responsibility in the matter; that though the interpleader case has not yet been tried as between respondent Takahashi and appellant Manos, the court made an ex parte order therein directing the money claimed by him to be paid over to Takahashi; that the clerk paid it over accordingly, but that the court subsequently vacated such ex parte order, it having been made without jurisdiction. If such deposit of money in the interpleader case and the entry of an interlocutory judgment therein exonerating the Produce Company in fact occurred before the judgment appealed from in the instant case, it would afford an additional reason why the court had no jurisdiction to enter such judgment here complained of. (Israel v. Bryan, 52 Cal.App. 66, 73 [197 P. 121].) However this may be, it is manifest that the interpleader cause and not the cause before us is the proper one in which to settle, as between respondent and appellant, the right to the money in dispute. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*376</span> But what has or has not been done in that case cannot under the record before us be considered on the present appeal.</p>\n<p> The judgment appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p> Barnard, P.

Heald, District Attorney (Imperial County), as Amicus Curiae, on Behalf of Respondent.</p>\n<p> Haines, J., pro tem.</p>\n<p> Defendant Kunishima was, during the year 1937, engaged in raising farm produce in Imperial County and appellant Manos claims to have been the assignee of Manos Brothers, to whom Kunishima in December of that year is said to have executed a promissory note for $4,000 and interest, secured by a crop mortgage on a tomato crop then growing on Kunishima's premises in that county, which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*369</span> mortgage is stated to have been in that month duly recorded. On July 12, 1938, respondent Takahashi commenced the instant action in the Superior Court of Imperial County against Kunishima to obtain judgment on certain labor claims aggregating $1,053, one of which Takahashi asserted to have been originally his own, and the other two of which he alleged that he had acquired by assignment. Pending this action he took out a writ of attachment and caused notice of garnishment thereunder to be served on the Consolidated Produce Co., Ltd., hereinafter referred to as the \"Produce Company\", a Los Angeles concern to which Kunishima had delivered the tomatoes. The Produce Company on July 15th made return in the words and figures following:</p>\n<p> \"To notice of garnishment and demand for a statement served on me this 15th day of July, A. D. 1938, by the sheriff of Los Angeles County, under and by virtue of a writ of attachment issued in the above entitled cause my answer is: That __________ I am indebted to __________, said defendant, in the sum of __________ Dollars, and that __________ I have __________ in __________ my possession __________ and under __________ my control __________ personal property belonging to said defendant, to-wit: No funds\"</p>\n<p> \"NOTE: Handled shipments for this account, but notified to effect by Manos Bros. of San Diego, California, they hold Crop Mortgage covering crops produced; and they rightfully entitled to proceeds and demanding payment thereon. Have therefore withheld payments until such a time as proper party proven rightfully entitled to these payments.\"</p>\n<p> \"Amount withheld $1140.91.\"</p>\n<p> Thereupon Takahashi filed in the case a petition, apparently conceived to be under the provisions of section 689 of the Code of Civil Procedure, claiming that the labor on which his claims were based had been bestowed on the crop delivered to the Produce Company and asking determination of the right to the money derived from the sale of the crop. The court directed a hearing on the matter and fixed August 24, 1938, as the time therefor, of which notice was given to the Produce Company but so far as appears to nobody else. In the meantime it enjoined the Produce Company from disbursing the $1140.91. Kunishima having defaulted in the main case, Takahashi proceeded to take judgment as he had prayed on July 26th, and on July 27th, he took out an execution thereon for $1,064 then due on the judgment, and had a notice <span class=\"star-pagination\">*370</span> of levy thereon served on the Produce Company which refused to pay the sheriff the funds in its hands but instead made return that it was not indebted to Kunishima and had in its possession or under its control no personal property belonging to him but did have in its possession $1140.91 as the sales price of produce consigned to it by Kunishima for sale but that Manos Brothers claimed such proceeds by virtue of a crop mortgage. On August 12th, Takahashi made an affidavit under section 717 of the Code of Civil Procedure asking that the Produce Company, Manos Brothers, and appellant George Manos appear and show cause why the money should not be paid to the sheriff. The court on that day issued an order to show cause accordingly, fixing August 24th as the time for the hearing on the matter, restraining the Produce Company in the meantime from doing anything to prejudice the proceeding and shortening to five days the time for service of the order. This order was served on all parties concerned but the service was not made on appellant until August 23d, and he apparently made no appearance on August 24th. The court minutes as of that date recite that \"Leave is granted to the plaintiff for a reference before Arthur W. Kennedy, attorney at law, on September 10, 1938, at 10 o'clock a. m.\"</p>\n<p> According to the recitals in the court's findings hereinafter referred to, the original petition filed for determination of the title to the property sought to be levied on under the writ of attachment, as well as the hearing asked for in the affidavit made under section 717 by way of a proceeding supplementary to execution, came on together before the court on August 24th, and were continued to August 31st, at which latter time Takahashi, Kunishima, Manos Brothers and appellant George Manos all did appear by counsel, and counsel for appellant George Manos, according to the recitals referred to in the findings, objected to the court's jurisdiction \"to determine the title to the property\" attached, and presented and sought leave to file a petition in intervention. This leave, however, the court denied.</p>\n<p> In this proposed petition in intervention appellant Manos set out the making of the note and crop mortgage by Kunishima in favor of Manos Brothers and the assignment of the same by Manos Brothers to him; that the tomatoes were subject to the mortgage lien; that the mortgage provided that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*371</span> the crop should be delivered into the mortgagee's possession for sale and the proceeds applied to the debt; that Kunishima, in violation of the terms of the mortgage and without notice to the mortgagee, had removed $1140.91 worth of tomatoes from the land and delivered the same to the Produce Company with instructions to sell them for his account; that the Produce Company had done so and realized therefrom $1140.91, which sum it held; that the case as between the respondent Takahashi and defendant Kunishima was collusive and instituted to defraud Manos and his assignors; that Kunishima was not in fact indebted to Takahashi; and that he, Manos, was entitled to the $1140.91.</p>\n<p> The hearing of August 31st was adjourned (according again to the recitals mentioned) for the taking of evidence in Los Angeles, pursuant to the reference made by the court, after which the court on October 25, 1938, rendered judgment for respondent Takahashi which, however, was vacated by consent and the matter reargued. Appellant claims that he was not represented at the taking of the evidence in Los Angeles and his counsel claim to have had no notice of the hearing there. The findings assert that they did have such notice thereof.</p>\n<p> The findings bear date December 17, 1938. They are of considerable length and, as we have stated, recite various proceedings above mentioned; undertake to determine that the claim of Manos Brothers and George Manos to a lien upon the funds in controversy by virtue of their crop mortgage is unsupported by the evidence, for the reason that on January 19, 1938, they filed an action in San Diego County, which was subsequently transferred to Imperial County, against Kunishima on the $4,000 promissory note and filed therein an attachment affidavit and secured the issuance of a writ of attachment and levy thereof on the said moneys in the possession of the Produce Company, whereby they waived their mortgage lien; further, that they waived it by reason of their apparent consent to Kunishima's sale of the crop and their lack of reasonable diligence in protecting their rights after the crop had been harvested. The court also found that by Takahashi's action in levying under his own writ of attachment on July 15, 1938, he obtained a prior lien on the money in the hands of the Produce Company and that he is entitled to satisfaction of his judgment therefrom. It was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*372</span> further found that the Produce Company had, prior to the making of said findings, filed an interpleader action in Imperial County wherein it named as defendants both Takahashi, Manos Brothers and George Manos, and had offered to deposit therein the sum of $1,064 with interest thereon from July 26, 1938, and costs, for disposition to whichever party should be adjudged entitled thereto, to which sums the court found, as above stated, that Takahashi was entitled.</p>\n<p> Pursuant to these findings and in accordance with certain conclusions of law drawn by it from them, the court thereupon proceeded in the instant case to adjudge Takahashi entitled to the money claimed by him, but to provide that upon the deposit by the Produce Company of the money in its hands with the county clerk of Imperial County, either in the instant case or in the interpleader action, such clerk should pay Takahashi therefrom enough to satisfy his judgment and hold the balance, if any, subject to the court's further order.

Weiand, at the time of his death on the 20th day of January, 1937, was forty-nine years of age, and had been engaged in railroading for some twenty-five years, about fourteen years with the defendant. On the 20th of January, 1937, Weiand was the fifth brakeman on an extra freight train comprising approximately one hundred six cars running from Gerber, in Tehama County, to Roseville, in Placer County. As fifth man, Weiand was responsible for the second twenty-five or thirty cars behind the engine, the first twenty-five or thirty cars being under the charge of the head brakeman, Paul Fizer. The train arrived in the Roseville yard in daylight at approximately 7:30 o'clock in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*503</span> the morning. It was a very cold morning, and many of the cars were covered with ice, snow and frost. The principal part of the defendant's yard at Roseville, California, lies west of the Lincoln Street crossing. The railroad tracks run in a general westerly and easterly direction. The train in question came into the Roseville yard from the north on a track commonly known as the Oregon lead. Just before this track reaches the defendant's depot or station, which is a short distance east of Lincoln Street, it turns in a general westerly direction and crosses Lincoln Street at right angles. The Oregon lead retains its identity until it reaches switch No. 2, which is 320 feet west of the west line of Lincoln Street. From this point, continuing west, the lead track is known as track No. 1. Track No. 2 branches off of the lead on the north at switch No. 2. The defendant's west-bound main line is south of the lead. A yard crew working in the west end of the yard had \"kicked\" two cabooses down the lead and into track 1 some twenty minutes before the train entered. These cabooses stood then about fifty feet from the frog over which trains would pass turning into track 2. Except for the cabooses, track 1 was unoccupied at that end of the yard. As the train turned over the frog into track 2, Weiand was caught between the caboose and the side of the car of the train upon which he was riding. He was found lying on the ground between the caboose and the moving train upon which he had been employed, in an unconscious condition. He lay with his head to the west in the direction of the travel of the train. His clothing was split, exposing the skin up and down the back from waist to shoulder. His sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth ribs were broken off an inch from the spine and had pierced the lung and spleen. His chest was crushed, and the whole chest wall was badly discolored. There were a number of lacerations distributed over the body. The left side of the skull was also fractured. He died within a short time. There was no eye-witness to the occurrence. When last seen he was standing on top of one of the moving cars of his train, just before his body was discovered, and while the train was entering the railroad yard at Roseville.</p>\n<p> The chief contention urged by appellant as a ground for reversal is that \"there is no evidence that the negligence of the defendant, if any, was the proximate cause of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*504</span> accident\". It relies upon the following familiar rule laid down in Wheelock v. Freiwald, 66 Fed.2d 694-698:</p>\n<p> \"A verdict cannot be permitted to stand, which rests upon conjecture, surmise or speculation, but plaintiff must produce substantial affirmative proof that the negligence of the carrier caused the injury, and 'where proven facts give equal support to each of two inconsistent inferences; in which event, neither of them being established, judgment, as a matter of law, must go against the party upon whom rests the necessity of sustaining one of these inferences as against the other, before he is entitled to recover.\" (Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Chamberlain, 288 U.S. 333 [53 S.Ct. 391, 77 L.Ed. 819].)\"\"</p>\n<p> Seeking to invoke the foregoing rule in the instant case, appellant states:</p>\n<p> \"The most logical cause of the accident and the only theory which coincides with the undisputed and uncontradicted evidence is that Weiand came to his death by reason of his own voluntary act in attempting to walk upon the top of a car, made slippery by ice and frozen snow, while it was in motion, and that he slipped and went off of the car feet first.\"</p>\n<p> [1] The law is settled that in an action brought under the provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, the rights of the plaintiff and the obligations of the defendant depend upon the act and the applicable principles of common law as interpreted by the federal courts, and not by the decisions of courts of the several states when in conflict therewith. We cannot see any material difference between the rule in the Wheelock case, quoted above, and the rule prevailing in this state to the effect that there must be substantial proof of negligence in any case to authorize a recovery. The above rule is predicated upon the theory that neither of two inconsistent inferences has been established. Obviously, if plaintiff has failed to make out a case for the jury on either of two theories, no recovery can be had. If, however, plaintiff has proven sufficient facts to justify a verdict upon one theory, the fact that there may be one or more other seemingly rational explanations of the episode in no manner precludes a recovery or invalidates the verdict. These are mere matters of argument to be presented to the jury. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*505</span></p>\n<p> [2] The first inquiry is: Was any negligence upon the part of defendant proven? It is contended by respondent that such negligence consisted in leaving the two cabooses at a point where the converging tracks were so close that there was insufficient \"clearance\" between the cabooses and passing freight cars, and particularly between the body of an employee who was in the act of descending from the top of a freight car by means of a \"ladder\" affixed to the side of said car, or who was on such ladder in the discharge of any other of his duties. The evidence shows that the distance between the corner of the easterly caboose and the ladder of a car of the same type upon which deceased was riding, is 16 1/2 inches. There is the further fact proven that the sway of the car incidental to passing over the switch might reduce this clearance some seven inches more. Sometimes, according to witness Wait, this swaying motion continues clear through the yard. The testimony of witness Keller shows that the cabooses stood on track No. 1, at a point about fifty feet west of the frog of the switch over which the train passed in moving on track No. 2. These two tracks merged at the switch. Witness Keller saw the body of Weiand immediately after the accident, and the relative positions of the passing cars in the train on which deceased was riding, and the two cabooses. Keller had been engaged for years in railroad work. He had worked in 1936 and 1937 for the defendant at Roseville as car inspector, and as general car foreman in Oakland during 1929. His duties were to inspect trains as they were coming in or leaving the terminal at Roseville, and he was so engaged on the day that Weiand was killed. He testified that there was not sufficient \"clearance\" between the east end of the caboose and the train on which Weiand was working. He testified that \"clearance is known as a safe distance from one car to another where it is safe in case a man on the ladder of a moving car, that he is safe, that he will not be struck by the car next to him.\" If there was insufficient \"clearance\" between the passing train and the cabooses, or one of them, the jury was justified in finding that the act of the company in leaving the cabooses too near the switch and consequently too close to the other track, was negligence. This fact was one for the jury to determine, and we are satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to sustain such a finding. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*506</span></p>\n<p> [3] The question then arises, as to whether or not such negligence was the proximate cause of the injury. We believe that the facts and circumstances shown by the record were sufficient to justify a finding in favor of respondent upon that issue, and to remove the verdict from the implication that it was the result of speculation and conjecture and without any factual foundation whatever. The testimony relating to the injuries received by Weiand (detailed supra), would support the inference that they were not the result of a \"fall\", but the result of a crushing received between the caboose and the moving car. At a point almost directly over the spot where the body was found, there were marks upon the side of the caboose which ran more parallel to the roof than in a vertical direction. The paint on the caboose was scuffed up and scratched westward. There were no marks whatever upon the roof of the caboose, though it is several inches lower than that portion of the roof of the car which was nearest to the caboose. The clothing of deceased was split open the entire distance up and down the back, just left of the spine. There was paint upon the shoes of deceased of the same color as that of the caboose. These and other facts disclosed by the record are ample to support a finding that while deceased was upon the side ladder of the car upon which he was riding, he was brushed off and crushed by the easterly caboose which had, through the negligence of defendant, been allowed to stand at a point on the track where there was insufficient \"clearance\", as that term is defined by the witness Keller. The opinion of Judge Rudkin, in the case of Hobbs, Wall &amp; Co. v. Petterson, 2 Fed.2d 594, (C.C.A.) answers the contention of appellant on this phase of the case:</p>\n<p> \"But the court was not compelled to accept any of the theories advanced by the plaintiff in error. The mere suggestion of such theories did not necessarily throw the case into the realm of speculation and compel a finding in its favor. As said by the court in Wabash Screen Door Co. v. Black, 126 Fed. 721, 725 [61 C.C.A. 639, 643]: 'While the evidence was circumstantial, it was ample in our opinion, to warrant the submission of the question to the jury under the instructions given. ... Doubtless a jury ought not to be permitted to speculate, in the sense of guess, between causes, when no reasonable explanation of the injury can be found in the testimony. ... But, in the absence of direct <span class=\"star-pagination\">*507</span> testimony, the simple suggestion of theories by the defense does not reduce the jury to mere speculation, and disqualify it from determining the cause of the injury complained of. The theories suggested may be forced and fanciful, finding no reasonable foundation in the facts proved. They may be explanations which do not explain; which the common sense of the jury, when applied to the testimony, would instantly reject.'\" (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p> The same holding is found in the case of Kulp v. Chicago, St. Paul, Minn. &amp; Omaha Ry. Co., 88 Fed.2d 466, (C.C.A.) where numerous authorities are cited in support thereof.</p>\n<p> [4] It is next urged that \"there is no evidence that at the time of the accident said Edward W. Weiand was acting within the scope of his employment with the defendant\". It is not contended that deceased was at a place where he at no time was not within the scope of his employment. The record is undisputed that a brakeman is called upon at certain times and in certain contingencies to ascend and descend the side ladder of a freight car. In this respect the case differs from many of the cases relied upon by appellant. The question is not whether deceased was doing an act which was altogether outside the scope of his employment but whether or not, upon this particular occasion, he was called upon to use the ladder. That it was the custom of a brakeman to act in the same manner as decedent in the discharge of his duties, was established by the evidence of witness Keller, who testified: \"It was a common thing, as the train came in, to see a brakeman on top of the train and somewheres near Lincoln street, why, to see them climb out and drop off of the train.\" Witnesses of both appellant and respondent testified that brakemen were required to descend and get off as the train entered the receiving track, and from the ground to inspect the running gear of their train. It is the contention of appellant, however, that this duty arose when the train came to a stop just before entering the railroad yards at Roseville. The evidence shows that the train did stop, but only momentarily--\"for a few seconds\", according to the engineer. It is during such an interval that appellant insists the duty arises, in respect to a brakeman, to inspect the running gear. Weiand was injured after the train had again started up, and after it had switched to the receiving track. There is testimony that the duties of the deceased would require him to descend <span class=\"star-pagination\">*508</span> from the car at a point after the train had entered the receiving track. The following is a question put to, and answer of witness Mauzy: \"What is the custom and practice, Mr. Mauzy, of brakemen riding on trains entering yards?\" \"Well, they are supposed to be out until they start in on the receiving track, or down part way on the receiving track, and I get off and watch my portion of the train.\" Witness Wait testified that men are expected to get out on the side of a train coming into the yards. In our opinion the evidence would support a finding to the effect that Weiand, in attempting to descend from the car where he did, was following a custom which prevailed in defendant's yard at Roseville, in respect to his duties, and that the case comes directly within the rule laid down in Texas &amp; P. R. Co. v. Harvey, 228 U.S. 319 [33 S.Ct. 518, 57 L.Ed. 852-857], where it is said:</p>\n<p> \"The other errors assigned concern the requests of the defendant below for a peremptory instruction in its favor because Harvey had placed himself in the window where none of his duties required him to be; but the record discloses that it was customary for a hostler's helper to get upon an engine and to look out of the cab window for the reasons we have stated, and for one helper to lend aid to another. We do not think that the testimony shows that Harvey was not in the line of his duties when he got upon the engine. ...\"</p>\n<p> Furthermore, the record shows without contradiction that there were a number of instances and contingencies which required a brakeman, in the line of his duties, to descend the ladder on the side of a car. It was a matter for the jury to decide, whether or not, upon the occasion here involved, Weiand acted within the scope of his employment. We are satisfied that the record justifies such a finding. We cannot accept the narrow and limited view taken by appellant, and believe that to do so would stultify a just and reasonable application of the rules of the law governing the relationship between employer and employee.</p>\n<p> [5] It is urged as another ground for reversal that the deceased assumed the risk of any injury under the circumstances. The rule applicable to such a defense is thus stated in Chicago, R. I. &amp; Pac. Ry. Co. v. Ward, 252 U.S. 18 [40 S.Ct. 275, 64 L.Ed. 430]: <span class=\"star-pagination\">*509</span></p>\n<p> \"As to the nature of the risk assumed by an employee in actions brought under the Employers' Liability Act, we took occasion to say in Chesapeake &amp; O. R. Co. v. De Atley, 241 U.S. 310, at page 315 [36 S.Ct. 564, 60 L.Ed. 1016-1020]. 'According to our decisions, the settled rule is not that it is the duty of an employee to exercise care to discover extraordinary dangers that may arise from the negligence of the employer or of those for whose conduct the employer is responsible, but that the employee may assume that the employer or his agents have exercised proper care with respect to his safety until notified to the contrary, unless the want of care and the danger arising from it are so obvious that an ordinarily careful person, under the circumstances, would observe and appreciate them.' ...\" (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p> The question here is whether or not the lack of sufficient clearance between the caboose and the train was \"so obvious that an ordinarily careful person, under the circumstances, would observe and appreciate them\". This was a question of fact for the jury. Several witnesses testified that it would be difficult or impossible for a man looking at the caboose from the east (and, by inference, from a position on the train similar to that occupied by the deceased when he was approaching the caboose), to tell whether or not there was sufficient \"clearance\", as we have described that term. The evidence is sufficient to justify a finding that the negligence of the defendant, in leaving the cabooses where they stood, presented a danger which was not obvious, and which, with the exercise of ordinary prudence, could not have been anticipated. [6] Deceased was under no duty to exercise care to discover dangers not ordinarily incident to the employment, but which resulted from the employer's negligence. (39 C.J., p. 692, sec. 896; 16 Cal.Jur., p. 1068, sec. 47.)</p>\n<p> [7] It is contended that the damages are excessive, in that they appear to have been given under the influence of passion and prejudice. We find nothing in the record to warrant this assertion. The decedent left a surviving wife. During the past six months before his death his earnings averaged $216 per month. He was forty-nine years of age, and his expectancy was 21.81 years. During the times that he was employed in railroad work his earnings were about $200 per month. It is true that at times he was not engaged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*510</span> in his regular work, and during such times he may have received less compensation. His ability to earn, rather than the amount actually earned, may be considered by the jury in arriving at the amount of damages to be awarded his widow. (Hosman v. Southern Pac. Co., 28 Cal.App.2d 621-634 [83 PaCal.2d 88].) The record is not vulnerable to this attack.</p>\n<p> [8] Finally, and in connection with the claim of excessive damages, it is urged that decedent was guilty of contributory negligence, and that the verdict should be reduced proportionately, under the provisions of the act mentioned above (U.S. Code, title Railroads, sec. 53). After reviewing the evidence, we cannot say, as a matter of law, that decedent was guilty of contributory negligence. The determination of this question of fact was a function committed solely by law to the jury. There is no merit in this point.</p>\n<p> The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p> Pullen, P.

Weiand to recover damages for the death of the latter, and is based upon the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The jury awarded damages in the sum of $30,000 and the appeal is from the judgment.</p>\n<p> Edward W. Weiand, at the time of his death on the 20th day of January, 1937, was forty-nine years of age, and had been engaged in railroading for some twenty-five years, about fourteen years with the defendant. On the 20th of January, 1937, Weiand was the fifth brakeman on an extra freight train comprising approximately one hundred six cars running from Gerber, in Tehama County, to Roseville, in Placer County. As fifth man, Weiand was responsible for the second twenty-five or thirty cars behind the engine, the first twenty-five or thirty cars being under the charge of the head brakeman, Paul Fizer. The train arrived in the Roseville yard in daylight at approximately 7:30 o'clock in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*503</span> the morning. It was a very cold morning, and many of the cars were covered with ice, snow and frost. The principal part of the defendant's yard at Roseville, California, lies west of the Lincoln Street crossing. The railroad tracks run in a general westerly and easterly direction. The train in question came into the Roseville yard from the north on a track commonly known as the Oregon lead. Just before this track reaches the defendant's depot or station, which is a short distance east of Lincoln Street, it turns in a general westerly direction and crosses Lincoln Street at right angles. The Oregon lead retains its identity until it reaches switch No. 2, which is 320 feet west of the west line of Lincoln Street. From this point, continuing west, the lead track is known as track No. 1. Track No. 2 branches off of the lead on the north at switch No. 2. The defendant's west-bound main line is south of the lead. A yard crew working in the west end of the yard had \"kicked\" two cabooses down the lead and into track 1 some twenty minutes before the train entered. These cabooses stood then about fifty feet from the frog over which trains would pass turning into track 2. Except for the cabooses, track 1 was unoccupied at that end of the yard. As the train turned over the frog into track 2, Weiand was caught between the caboose and the side of the car of the train upon which he was riding. He was found lying on the ground between the caboose and the moving train upon which he had been employed, in an unconscious condition. He lay with his head to the west in the direction of the travel of the train. His clothing was split, exposing the skin up and down the back from waist to shoulder. His sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth ribs were broken off an inch from the spine and had pierced the lung and spleen. His chest was crushed, and the whole chest wall was badly discolored. There were a number of lacerations distributed over the body. The left side of the skull was also fractured. He died within a short time. There was no eye-witness to the occurrence. When last seen he was standing on top of one of the moving cars of his train, just before his body was discovered, and while the train was entering the railroad yard at Roseville.</p>\n<p> The chief contention urged by appellant as a ground for reversal is that \"there is no evidence that the negligence of the defendant, if any, was the proximate cause of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*504</span> accident\". It relies upon the following familiar rule laid down in Wheelock v. Freiwald, 66 Fed.2d 694-698:</p>\n<p> \"A verdict cannot be permitted to stand, which rests upon conjecture, surmise or speculation, but plaintiff must produce substantial affirmative proof that the negligence of the carrier caused the injury, and 'where proven facts give equal support to each of two inconsistent inferences; in which event, neither of them being established, judgment, as a matter of law, must go against the party upon whom rests the necessity of sustaining one of these inferences as against the other, before he is entitled to recover.\" (Pennsylvania R.

We cannot see any material difference between the rule in the Wheelock case, quoted above, and the rule prevailing in this state to the effect that there must be substantial proof of negligence in any case to authorize a recovery. The above rule is predicated upon the theory that neither of two inconsistent inferences has been established. Obviously, if plaintiff has failed to make out a case for the jury on either of two theories, no recovery can be had. If, however, plaintiff has proven sufficient facts to justify a verdict upon one theory, the fact that there may be one or more other seemingly rational explanations of the episode in no manner precludes a recovery or invalidates the verdict. These are mere matters of argument to be presented to the jury. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*505</span></p>\n<p> [2] The first inquiry is: Was any negligence upon the part of defendant proven? It is contended by respondent that such negligence consisted in leaving the two cabooses at a point where the converging tracks were so close that there was insufficient \"clearance\" between the cabooses and passing freight cars, and particularly between the body of an employee who was in the act of descending from the top of a freight car by means of a \"ladder\" affixed to the side of said car, or who was on such ladder in the discharge of any other of his duties. The evidence shows that the distance between the corner of the easterly caboose and the ladder of a car of the same type upon which deceased was riding, is 16 1/2 inches. There is the further fact proven that the sway of the car incidental to passing over the switch might reduce this clearance some seven inches more. Sometimes, according to witness Wait, this swaying motion continues clear through the yard. The testimony of witness Keller shows that the cabooses stood on track No. 1, at a point about fifty feet west of the frog of the switch over which the train passed in moving on track No. 2. These two tracks merged at the switch. Witness Keller saw the body of Weiand immediately after the accident, and the relative positions of the passing cars in the train on which deceased was riding, and the two cabooses. Keller had been engaged for years in railroad work. He had worked in 1936 and 1937 for the defendant at Roseville as car inspector, and as general car foreman in Oakland during 1929. His duties were to inspect trains as they were coming in or leaving the terminal at Roseville, and he was so engaged on the day that Weiand was killed. He testified that there was not sufficient \"clearance\" between the east end of the caboose and the train on which Weiand was working. He testified that \"clearance is known as a safe distance from one car to another where it is safe in case a man on the ladder of a moving car, that he is safe, that he will not be struck by the car next to him.\" If there was insufficient \"clearance\" between the passing train and the cabooses, or one of them, the jury was justified in finding that the act of the company in leaving the cabooses too near the switch and consequently too close to the other track, was negligence. This fact was one for the jury to determine, and we are satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to sustain such a finding. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*506</span></p>\n<p> [3] The question then arises, as to whether or not such negligence was the proximate cause of the injury. We believe that the facts and circumstances shown by the record were sufficient to justify a finding in favor of respondent upon that issue, and to remove the verdict from the implication that it was the result of speculation and conjecture and without any factual foundation whatever. The testimony relating to the injuries received by Weiand (detailed supra), would support the inference that they were not the result of a \"fall\", but the result of a crushing received between the caboose and the moving car. At a point almost directly over the spot where the body was found, there were marks upon the side of the caboose which ran more parallel to the roof than in a vertical direction. The paint on the caboose was scuffed up and scratched westward. There were no marks whatever upon the roof of the caboose, though it is several inches lower than that portion of the roof of the car which was nearest to the caboose. The clothing of deceased was split open the entire distance up and down the back, just left of the spine. There was paint upon the shoes of deceased of the same color as that of the caboose. These and other facts disclosed by the record are ample to support a finding that while deceased was upon the side ladder of the car upon which he was riding, he was brushed off and crushed by the easterly caboose which had, through the negligence of defendant, been allowed to stand at a point on the track where there was insufficient \"clearance\", as that term is defined by the witness Keller. The opinion of Judge Rudkin, in the case of Hobbs, Wall &amp; Co. v. Petterson, 2 Fed.2d 594, (C.C.A.) answers the contention of appellant on this phase of the case:</p>\n<p> \"But the court was not compelled to accept any of the theories advanced by the plaintiff in error. The mere suggestion of such theories did not necessarily throw the case into the realm of speculation and compel a finding in its favor. As said by the court in Wabash Screen Door Co. v. Black, 126 Fed. 721, 725 [61 C.C.A. 639, 643]: 'While the evidence was circumstantial, it was ample in our opinion, to warrant the submission of the question to the jury under the instructions given. ... Doubtless a jury ought not to be permitted to speculate, in the sense of guess, between causes, when no reasonable explanation of the injury can be found in the testimony. ... But, in the absence of direct <span class=\"star-pagination\">*507</span> testimony, the simple suggestion of theories by the defense does not reduce the jury to mere speculation, and disqualify it from determining the cause of the injury complained of. The theories suggested may be forced and fanciful, finding no reasonable foundation in the facts proved. They may be explanations which do not explain; which the common sense of the jury, when applied to the testimony, would instantly reject.'\" (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p> The same holding is found in the case of Kulp v. Chicago, St. Paul, Minn. &amp; Omaha Ry. Co., 88 Fed.2d 466, (C.C.A.) where numerous authorities are cited in support thereof.</p>\n<p> [4] It is next urged that \"there is no evidence that at the time of the accident said Edward W. Weiand was acting within the scope of his employment with the defendant\". It is not contended that deceased was at a place where he at no time was not within the scope of his employment. The record is undisputed that a brakeman is called upon at certain times and in certain contingencies to ascend and descend the side ladder of a freight car. In this respect the case differs from many of the cases relied upon by appellant. The question is not whether deceased was doing an act which was altogether outside the scope of his employment but whether or not, upon this particular occasion, he was called upon to use the ladder. That it was the custom of a brakeman to act in the same manner as decedent in the discharge of his duties, was established by the evidence of witness Keller, who testified: \"It was a common thing, as the train came in, to see a brakeman on top of the train and somewheres near Lincoln street, why, to see them climb out and drop off of the train.\" Witnesses of both appellant and respondent testified that brakemen were required to descend and get off as the train entered the receiving track, and from the ground to inspect the running gear of their train. It is the contention of appellant, however, that this duty arose when the train came to a stop just before entering the railroad yards at Roseville. The evidence shows that the train did stop, but only momentarily--\"for a few seconds\", according to the engineer. It is during such an interval that appellant insists the duty arises, in respect to a brakeman, to inspect the running gear. Weiand was injured after the train had again started up, and after it had switched to the receiving track. There is testimony that the duties of the deceased would require him to descend <span class=\"star-pagination\">*508</span> from the car at a point after the train had entered the receiving track. The following is a question put to, and answer of witness Mauzy: \"What is the custom and practice, Mr. Mauzy, of brakemen riding on trains entering yards?\" \"Well, they are supposed to be out until they start in on the receiving track, or down part way on the receiving track, and I get off and watch my portion of the train.\" Witness Wait testified that men are expected to get out on the side of a train coming into the yards. In our opinion the evidence would support a finding to the effect that Weiand, in attempting to descend from the car where he did, was following a custom which prevailed in defendant's yard at Roseville, in respect to his duties, and that the case comes directly within the rule laid down in Texas &amp; P. R. Co. v. Harvey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621063\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621063/texas-pacific-r-co-v-harvey/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span> [33 S.Ct. 518, 57 L.Ed. 852-857], where it is said:</p>\n<p> \"The other errors assigned concern the requests of the defendant below for a peremptory instruction in its favor because Harvey had placed himself in the window where none of his duties required him to be; but the record discloses that it was customary for a hostler's helper to get upon an engine and to look out of the cab window for the reasons we have stated, and for one helper to lend aid to another. We do not think that the testimony shows that Harvey was not in the line of his duties when he got upon the engine. ...\"</p>\n<p> Furthermore, the record shows without contradiction that there were a number of instances and contingencies which required a brakeman, in the line of his duties, to descend the ladder on the side of a car. It was a matter for the jury to decide, whether or not, upon the occasion here involved, Weiand acted within the scope of his employment. We are satisfied that the record justifies such a finding. We cannot accept the narrow and limited view taken by appellant, and believe that to do so would stultify a just and reasonable application of the rules of the law governing the relationship between employer and employee.</p>\n<p> [5] It is urged as another ground for reversal that the deceased assumed the risk of any injury under the circumstances. The rule applicable to such a defense is thus stated in Chicago, R. I. &amp; Pac. Ry. Co. v. Ward, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99523\"><a href=\"/opinion/99523/chicago-ri-pr-co-v-ward/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span> [40 S.Ct. 275, 64 L.Ed. 430]: <span class=\"star-pagination\">*509</span></p>\n<p> \"As to the nature of the risk assumed by an employee in actions brought under the Employers' Liability Act, we took occasion to say in Chesapeake &amp; O. R. Co. v. De Atley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98745\"><a href=\"/opinion/98745/chesapeake-ohio-r-co-v-de-atley/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span>, at page 315 [36 S.Ct. 564, 60 L.Ed. 1016-1020]. 'According to our decisions, the settled rule is not that it is the duty of an employee to exercise care to discover extraordinary dangers that may arise from the negligence of the employer or of those for whose conduct the employer is responsible, but that the employee may assume that the employer or his agents have exercised proper care with respect to his safety until notified to the contrary, unless the want of care and the danger arising from it are so obvious that an ordinarily careful person, under the circumstances, would observe and appreciate them.' ...\" (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p> The question here is whether or not the lack of sufficient clearance between the caboose and the train was \"so obvious that an ordinarily careful person, under the circumstances, would observe and appreciate them\". This was a question of fact for the jury. Several witnesses testified that it would be difficult or impossible for a man looking at the caboose from the east (and, by inference, from a position on the train similar to that occupied by the deceased when he was approaching the caboose), to tell whether or not there was sufficient \"clearance\", as we have described that term. The evidence is sufficient to justify a finding that the negligence of the defendant, in leaving the cabooses where they stood, presented a danger which was not obvious, and which, with the exercise of ordinary prudence, could not have been anticipated. [6] Deceased was under no duty to exercise care to discover dangers not ordinarily incident to the employment, but which resulted from the employer's negligence. (39 C.J., p. 692, sec. 896; 16 Cal.Jur., p. 1068, sec. 47.)</p>\n<p> [7] It is contended that the damages are excessive, in that they appear to have been given under the influence of passion and prejudice. We find nothing in the record to warrant this assertion. The decedent left a surviving wife. During the past six months before his death his earnings averaged $216 per month. He was forty-nine years of age, and his expectancy was 21.81 years. During the times that he was employed in railroad work his earnings were about $200 per month. It is true that at times he was not engaged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*510</span> in his regular work, and during such times he may have received less compensation. His ability to earn, rather than the amount actually earned, may be considered by the jury in arriving at the amount of damages to be awarded his widow. (Hosman v. Southern Pac. Co., 28 Cal.App.2d 621-634 [83 PaCal.2d 88].) The record is not vulnerable to this attack.</p>\n<p> [8] Finally, and in connection with the claim of excessive damages, it is urged that decedent was guilty of contributory negligence, and that the verdict should be reduced proportionately, under the provisions of the act mentioned above (U.S. Code, title Railroads, sec. 53). After reviewing the evidence, we cannot say, as a matter of law, that decedent was guilty of contributory negligence. The determination of this question of fact was a function committed solely by law to the jury. There is no merit in this point.</p>\n<p> The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p> Pullen, P.

Respondent was the Studebaker distributor in Imperial County. Appellant floored one sedan automobile and one automobile truck for respondent and accepted as to each a trust receipt and time draft which constituted the agreement of the parties as to each vehicle. Appellant filed this action in two counts to recover the unpaid balance of the amounts which respondent agreed to pay for the automobile and truck, according to the trust receipt-time draft transaction after respondent had placed the vehicles with a subdealer who had sold them and absconded with the proceeds. The case was tried before the court sitting without a jury, resulting in a judgment in favor of respondent. The judgment also allowed respondent a recovery against appellant on a cross-complaint for payments which respondent had made to appellant to apply on the purchase price of the cars in question after the subdealer had disposed of them. Judgment was duly entered. Appellant moved the court for a new trial, which motion was denied.</p>\n<p> On July 6, 1936, the respondent signed a dealer's application for flooring plan accommodations. Thereafter respondent, as distributor for all of Imperial County, purchased Studebaker automobiles which were financed by appellant. On the 28th day of January, 1937, the above-named respondent executed and delivered to appellant wholesale documents consisting of a trust receipt and a time draft for the flooring of three Studebaker sedans, one of which was the sedan in question. The appellant caused the automobile described to be delivered to the respondent at El Centro. The time draft above mentioned was accepted by the respondent. The trust receipt-time draft instrument had the trust receipt printed on one side of the sheet and the time draft on the opposite side. Hawley, the respondent, had been in the habit of leaving automobiles which he had secured in the above-mentioned manner and which had been financed by the appellant in the same manner as above related, with various dealers in Imperial County for display and sale purposes. When appellant's car checker came to Imperial County twice each month, he went to nearly every town in Imperial County to find all of the cars which had been left with the respondent and floored for the respondent on the same terms and conditions as the above cars were left with him. Respondent furnished <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> all Studebaker dealers in Imperial County with all Studebaker cars and trucks sold by such dealers in Imperial County and he received a commission known as an \"over-ride\" from the Studebaker Corporation for all cars delivered to dealers in Imperial County. The evidence disclosed that if for any reason the dealers with whom Hawley had left the cars had not sold them, the cars so left for display purposes were often returned to the respondent Hawley. Appellant and respondent had no agreement as to where respondent Hawley should keep or store the cars which were financed by appellant. Since Hawley was a distributor and not a mere retail dealer, appellant did not object to his leaving cars with dealers throughout the county as stated. Between June 11, 1937, and July 2, 1937, appellant, through its agent, checked the automobiles which respondent Hawley was supposed to have in his possession and found the above-described sedan and the 1 1/2-ton truck missing (the 1 1/2-ton truck being the subject of appellant's second cause of action). Appellant made verbal and written demands on respondent immediately, demanding payment of $752.65 balance due on the Studebaker sedan above described and also demanded $752, the balance due on the 1 1/2-ton truck. The 1 1/2-ton truck was delivered to respondent on March 27, 1937. The respondent at the time of such delivery executed and delivered to appellant a trust receipt and time draft in the sum of $752 as consideration for the flooring of the truck, which time draft was accepted by the respondent.</p>\n<p> The evidence disclosed that the respondent Hawley left the 1 1/2-ton truck above described with a dealer at Calexico, Imperial County, California. This dealer, whose name was Quiros, is hereafter referred to as Calexico Motors. The evidence does not show the exact date when the truck was taken from El Centro to Calexico. Respondent Hawley does not contend that he ever asked permission of appellant corporation to take the truck to Calexico or to leave it with Calexico Motors.</p>\n<p> The evidence disclosed that respondent Hawley, without the knowledge or consent of appellant, caused the truck to be left with the Calexico dealer with authority to said dealer to sell the truck and that the Calexico dealer disposed of the truck and did not pay either Hawley or appellant corporation, and now respondent's only defense to the second cause <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> of action pertaining to the truck is that he claims that appellant knew that the truck was at Calexico Motors for several weeks before the Calexico dealer sold it and that appellant knew that the Calexico dealer made some alterations as to the frame of the truck and that therefore and thereafter respondent was completely relieved of the obligation created by the trust receipt-time draft transaction and that appellant was estopped from denying that it consented to the placing of the truck in the possession of Calexico Motors.</p>\n<p> [1] Respondent first claims that appellant's complaint sets forth only a cause of action for conversion; that when respondent established the fact that the property was placed in the hands of a third party with the consent and knowledge of the owner, he was no longer responsible to the owner. The complaint contains many averments essentially necessary to an action for conversion but the complaint also alleges the elements of contract, breach of contract, and damage. The appellant alleged: \"That the defendant signed a trust receipt for said automobile and to which there was attached a time draft which was accepted by said defendant. That attached hereto and marked Exhibit 'A' and by reference made a part hereof is a true copy of said trust receipt above mentioned and a true copy of the time draft attached thereto. ... That plaintiff has made demand upon the defendant for said automobile or for the balance owing on the purchase price thereof. ... That defendant has failed and neglected to pay the plaintiff the balance of the purchase price of said car, to-wit, $768.17, or any part thereof except that on June 23rd, 1937, the said defendant paid the plaintiff the sum of $38.17 to apply as part payment on said car, leaving a net balance of $730.00, which is now past due, owing, payable, and unpaid. ... \"There is a similar allegation as to the second count of the complaint. Respondent apparently adopted the view that the action was upon the contract, as his pleadings are based on a theory beyond formal denial of conversion and contain allegations of matters by way of avoidance of the terms of the contract set up in appellant's complaint.</p>\n<p> A closely parallel case is presented in Cass v. Ocean Park Bath Co., 45 Cal.App. 656 [188 P. 616]. In that case the court, while observing that the complaint was bad for misjoinder of causes of action, pointed out that the defendant's remedy was by demurrer under section 430 of the Code of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> Civil Procedure and that a failure to demur constituted a waiver of the objection under section 434 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and held that the defendant had breached the contract in failing, on demand, to redeliver the goods entrusted to his care and instructed the trial court to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff. That case and the instant case proceeded to trial upon the issues joined by the complaint and answer without attack by demurrer. In this case the time draft and trust receipt were signed on the same day as part of the same transaction and preceded the delivery of the cars to the respondent.</p>\n<p> [2] Since the trust receipt came into common use as a device to facilitate the sales of automobiles, its nature has been widely discussed by the courts. The weight of opinion seems to be that a trust receipt and a time draft executed at the same time, together constitute a conditional sales contract. That view of the matter was adopted by our Appellate Court in Commercial Acceptance Trust v. Bailey, 87 Cal.App. 117 [261 P. 743]. It is apparent that the sole purpose of the two instruments, the trust receipt and the time draft, was to provide security for the payment to C. I. T. Corporation of the agreed purchase price of the vehicles delivered to Hawley. The function of the time draft is apparently to fix the time when the obligation should be paid. The sale price of each car is fixed in the trust receipt-time draft. The two instruments were unquestionably made parts of one transaction and should be considered together. Under this interpretation, the transaction was more than the ordinary trust agreement and the relationship was not that of trustor and trustee as ordinarily understood.</p>\n<p> [3] Respondent next contends that the contract resulting from the execution and delivery of the time draft and trust receipt to the appellant and the delivery of the cars to the respondent was rescinded by agreement and the court so found. Appellant claims that the evidence was wholly insufficient to support any such conclusion of law. The trial court found that \"while said so-called trust receipt was in full force and effect and before any breach thereof, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into an oral agreement that the same be waived, abandoned and rescinded as to the automobile described ... and that the same was then and there so mutually waived, abandoned and rescinded between the parties. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> ... That the plaintiff consented to the change in possession of the two automobiles referred to in the plaintiff's complaint and thus waived the terms of said trust receipt and is estopped to claim said automobiles or the proceeds thereof from the defendant.\"</p>\n<p> As to the second count, it is agreed that the truck was delivered to respondent under the written trust receipt-time draft. Possession of the truck was given to Calexico Motors by respondent. The only evidence supporting respondent's contention and the court's finding that the parties entered into an oral agreement that the trust receipt-time draft was rescinded and waived for the reason that appellant was estopped from denying that possession of the truck was transferred to the Calexico Motors without its consent, was the fact of its knowledge of the possession being in the Calexico Motors when it was checked by the agent of appellant and he observed alterations being made thereon in the place of business of Calexico Motors. We are thoroughly convinced that this evidence falls short of supporting the finding that the parties mutually agreed that a rescission of the trust receipt-time draft was thereby effected. The mere knowledge of the presence of the truck at the Calexico Motors under the circumstances related would not operate as an estoppel as found by the court. The trust receipt-time draft did not preclude respondent from giving possession of the truck to any of his agents in Imperial Valley. Appellants at all times treated the truck as in the possession of respondent, as disclosed by their checking sheet record.</p>\n<p> [4] An estoppel may arise from silence as well as from words or conduct. But this is only where there is a duty to speak, and where the party upon whom such duty rests has an opportunity to speak, and, knowing that the circumstances require him to speak, remains silent. The circumstances attending the entire transaction must be such as to make it reasonably probable that the person seeking to set up the estoppel has suffered prejudice by the other's unreasonable acquiescence. There must be something wilful or culpable in the silence. (Eltinge v. Santos, 171 Cal. 278 [152 P. 915, Ann. Cas. 1917A, 1143]; Stern v. Sunset Road Oil Co., 47 Cal.App. 334 [190 P. 651]; Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1962, subd. 3.) For the reasons expressed, the judgment as to the second count of necessity must be reversed. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span></p>\n<p> [5] The Studebaker sedan described in the first cause of action of appellant's complaint was originally delivered to respondent Hawley at El Centro. Hawley apparently had it on his floor at El Centro for several weeks and then permitted it to be left with the Calexico dealer, known as Calexico Motors, with authority to sell the same. The Calexico dealer sold the sedan and did not pay either Hawley or appellant corporation.</p>\n<p> The only additional substantial fact that can be offered to support respondent's theory and the court's finding that a rescission of the trust receipt-time draft was effected must be based on a telephone conversation. The testimony of respondent Hawley in relation thereto was as follows: \"Q. (By Mr. Childers.) That conversation was with Mr. Schrader, or whoever it was you talked to? A. I immediately called C. I. T. after having been requested to deliver the cars to Calexico by Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Schrader O.K.'d, or told me that I might deliver them to Mr. Jenkins to take to Calexico Motors. Q. Who is Mr. Jenkins? A. Mr. Jenkins was the Pacific Coast representative of the Studebaker Corporation. The Court: May I ask, did you say Mr. Schrader represented C. I. T.? A. C. I. T. The Court: He is the local representative of C. I. T.? A. Yes, sir. Q. Then what did you do? A. I called Mr. Jenkins back to Calexico and it happened that it hadn't been over ten or fifteen minutes, so I called him and told him C. I. T. had O.K.'d the removal of the cars. Q. What did you next do? A. I had to leave my business, place of business where the cars were and was gone for about two hours, and when I got back the cars had been taken. Mr. Jenkins had brought a couple of drivers up.\"</p>\n<p> During the cross-examination of Hawley he testified as follows: \"Q. (By Mr. Smith): When you called Mr. Schrader, just what did you say to him and what did he say to you? A. Well, so far as the exact words are concerned, I couldn't repeat them, but I had been requested by Mr. Jenkins to let him take the cars to Calexico and I told Mr. Schrader about that request and Mr. Schrader granted the request. Q. Tell what you said in substance and what he said. A. That would be pretty hard to recall those exact words. I immediately called Mr. Jenkins back after talking to Mr. Schrader and told him the request had been granted by C. I. T. Q. Let's go back and get what was said by Mr. Schrader and what was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> said by you. A. I haven't any copy of it, all I could give you is an idea of what he said. Q. Did you tell him Mr. Jenkins the Pacific Coast factory representative wanted to take cars to Calexico? A. That is right. Q. What did he say? A. He granted that request. Q. What did he say? A. I don't remember. Q. Is that all that was said, just a short conversation? A. Just a short conversation. Q. You didn't tell him that you were going to sell the cars to Calexico Motors. A. I did not. Q. Or did you tell him whether or not the cars would be returned to El Centro? A. I did not. Q. Did you tell him that he was out of cars down there and you wanted to let him take them for a few days? A. I don't think so. Mr. Jenkins may have given some reason for taking them down there and I might have told them the reason Mr. Jenkins wanted them. Q. You had, before that time, loaned them cars without selling them, to let them have to show in their show room? A. On the opening Mr. Jenkins made the same request. Q. On that occasion you just loaned them and brought them back? A. I think most of them were returned. I am pretty sure one sold down there and they paid C. I. T. for it.\"</p>\n<p> The testimony of Mr. Schrader, the agent for C. I. T. Corporation, regarding the telephone conversation was as follows: \"Q. (By Mr. Smith): Mr. Schrader, you are the El Centro manager of C. I. T.? A. Yes, sir. Q. And do you recall a telephone conversation with Mr. Hawley on or about the latter part of May, 1937, in which he asked something about Mr. Jenkins wanting a car to take to Calexico Motors? A. I do. ... Q. What did he say to you and what did you say to him in that conversation? A. Hawley called up and asked for permission to take the cars down to Calexico Motors and he wanted to get my O. K. Q. What did you say? A. I said, 'If you are going to do that, Hawley, you should go ahead and change title to floor in the name of Calexico Motors like we handled it previously,' and he said, 'No, it is going to be down there for a few days, and in their storage, where and just as a loan, and it will be returned,' and I said, 'You do so at your own risk,' because, after all, it is floored in Mr. Hawley. So he took it down, and the next thing I knew, the cars were there. ... Q. You have no agreement with him as to where he could store cars, did you? A. No, he could store them anywhere he wanted to.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span></p>\n<p> From this conversation as given by both Hawley and Schrader, it is quite apparent that Hawley never did say anything to Schrader which would lead Schrader or the C. I. T. Corporation to believe that Hawley expected to be relieved of the obligation of paying for or accounting for the truck and automobile.</p>\n<p> One of appellant's witnesses testified on cross-examination, in reference to how Hawley handled similar transactions when sales were effected by one of his subdealers, as follows: \"Q. (By Mr. Smith): Explain now. A. Mr. Hawley, as distributor for Imperial County for passenger cars, would have his own stock of cars in his possession on which he had a flooring arrangement for them with C. I. T. If he wanted to sell a car to one of his subdealers he would call C. I. T. to find out if that subdealer had a line of credit with us and could agree to pay cash to him. The subdealer would come in and take possession of the car and the two of them, sometimes one of them separately, would come to our office and sign a trust receipt for the new dealer and Mr. Hawley would sign a bill of sale passing title, selling it for the full price to this dealer. ... Q. That was never done with these two cars? A. It was never asked of us. He had done it on other occasions with the Calexico Motors, ...\"</p>\n<p> In addition to this, respondent offered in evidence an invoice in which he charged the sedan and the truck to the Calexico dealer. It reads in part as follows:</p>\n<p> \"VALENS OIL CO.\"</p>\n<p> \"Independently Owned by\"</p>\n<p> J. H. HAWLEY ...</p>\n<p> \"Sold to Calexico Motors. ...\"</p>\n<p> \"1 St. Regis Sedan...$818.60\"</p>\n<p> \"FOR RESALE Delivered by J. H. H. ...\"</p>\n<p> Also dated \"6-24-1937\" and entitled as above:</p>\n<p> \"1 1-1/2 ton truck $850.00\"</p>\n<p> \"... FOR RESALE Delivered by JHH.\"</p>\n<p> By this invoice the intentions of respondent became quite apparent. If the two vehicles in question had been billed and an invoice sent by C. I. T. Corporation to the Calexico dealer, then there would be some force to respondent's argument <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> that C. I. T. Corporation had abandoned and waived its contract with him and had agreed to look to Calexico Motors for payment, but by the invoice mentioned, respondent personally billed the Calexico dealer with the two vehicles for money due Mr. Hawley. That act certainly was not consistent with his present argument that C. I. T. Corporation had waived and abandoned Hawley's written obligation. Appellant Hawley recognized his obligation to C. I. T. Corporation after the Calexico dealer had disposed of the sedan and the truck by making payments on these contracts to C. I. T. Corporation. There is no dispute that the payments were made several weeks after the cars had been taken to the Calexico dealer and even after they had been sold by the Calexico dealer and after he had absconded. Respondent never denied his obligations to appellant until after suit was filed.</p>\n<p> [6] It is claimed by respondent that the payments were made under threat of suit and the trial court allowed a recovery of the amount so paid. It is not legal duress to threaten to or actually take advantage of the usual remedy by suit for the enforcement of a debt or obligation. (Holt v. Thomas, 105 Cal. 273 [38 P. 891]; Burke v. Gould, 105 Cal. 277 [38 P. 733]; Rooney v. Snow, 131 Cal. 51 [63 P. 155].)</p>\n<p> [7] Hawley endeavored to collect for the two vehicles from the Calexico dealer after the Calexico dealer had sold them, but before he had absconded. We note in reading the transcript of the evidence that two Studebaker sedans were taken to the Calexico dealer on the day of the telephone conversation and that Hawley himself later went to Calexico and brought one of the sedans back to El Centro where he, Hawley, sold it. Respondent does not contend that there was any other act, written document, or oral conversation which relieved him of his responsibility except the telephone conversation mentioned. Assuming the correctness of the telephone conversation as represented by respondent, we are unable to accept the finding that this evidence sufficiently supported the ruling that the facts related amounted to a rescission, waiver and abandonment of the contract between appellant and respondent. Consent is not mutual, unless the parties all agree upon the same thing in the same sense. (Sec. 1580, Civ. Code.) From the foregoing, it is plain that there never was a meeting of the minds to abandon or rescind the obligations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> of respondent. (Western Oil etc. Co. v. Sullivan, 128 Cal.App. 319 [17 PaCal.2d 156]; Civ. Code, secs. 1698, 1699; Miller v. Steen, 34 Cal. 138; Hogan v. Anthony, 52 Cal.App. 158 [198 P. 47]; Sanborn v. Ballanfonte, 98 Cal.App. 482 [277 P. 152].) The motion for a new trial should have been granted.</p>\n<p> For the reasons expressed, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p> Barnard, P.

Hawley, the respondent, had been in the habit of leaving automobiles which he had secured in the above-mentioned manner and which had been financed by the appellant in the same manner as above related, with various dealers in Imperial County for display and sale purposes. When appellant's car checker came to Imperial County twice each month, he went to nearly every town in Imperial County to find all of the cars which had been left with the respondent and floored for the respondent on the same terms and conditions as the above cars were left with him. Respondent furnished <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> all Studebaker dealers in Imperial County with all Studebaker cars and trucks sold by such dealers in Imperial County and he received a commission known as an \"over-ride\" from the Studebaker Corporation for all cars delivered to dealers in Imperial County. The evidence disclosed that if for any reason the dealers with whom Hawley had left the cars had not sold them, the cars so left for display purposes were often returned to the respondent Hawley. Appellant and respondent had no agreement as to where respondent Hawley should keep or store the cars which were financed by appellant. Since Hawley was a distributor and not a mere retail dealer, appellant did not object to his leaving cars with dealers throughout the county as stated. Between June 11, 1937, and July 2, 1937, appellant, through its agent, checked the automobiles which respondent Hawley was supposed to have in his possession and found the above-described sedan and the 1 1/2-ton truck missing (the 1 1/2-ton truck being the subject of appellant's second cause of action). Appellant made verbal and written demands on respondent immediately, demanding payment of $752.65 balance due on the Studebaker sedan above described and also demanded $752, the balance due on the 1 1/2-ton truck. The 1 1/2-ton truck was delivered to respondent on March 27, 1937. The respondent at the time of such delivery executed and delivered to appellant a trust receipt and time draft in the sum of $752 as consideration for the flooring of the truck, which time draft was accepted by the respondent.</p>\n<p> The evidence disclosed that the respondent Hawley left the 1 1/2-ton truck above described with a dealer at Calexico, Imperial County, California. This dealer, whose name was Quiros, is hereafter referred to as Calexico Motors. The evidence does not show the exact date when the truck was taken from El Centro to Calexico. Respondent Hawley does not contend that he ever asked permission of appellant corporation to take the truck to Calexico or to leave it with Calexico Motors.</p>\n<p> The evidence disclosed that respondent Hawley, without the knowledge or consent of appellant, caused the truck to be left with the Calexico dealer with authority to said dealer to sell the truck and that the Calexico dealer disposed of the truck and did not pay either Hawley or appellant corporation, and now respondent's only defense to the second cause <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> of action pertaining to the truck is that he claims that appellant knew that the truck was at Calexico Motors for several weeks before the Calexico dealer sold it and that appellant knew that the Calexico dealer made some alterations as to the frame of the truck and that therefore and thereafter respondent was completely relieved of the obligation created by the trust receipt-time draft transaction and that appellant was estopped from denying that it consented to the placing of the truck in the possession of Calexico Motors.</p>\n<p> [1] Respondent first claims that appellant's complaint sets forth only a cause of action for conversion; that when respondent established the fact that the property was placed in the hands of a third party with the consent and knowledge of the owner, he was no longer responsible to the owner. The complaint contains many averments essentially necessary to an action for conversion but the complaint also alleges the elements of contract, breach of contract, and damage. The appellant alleged: \"That the defendant signed a trust receipt for said automobile and to which there was attached a time draft which was accepted by said defendant. That attached hereto and marked Exhibit 'A' and by reference made a part hereof is a true copy of said trust receipt above mentioned and a true copy of the time draft attached thereto. ... That plaintiff has made demand upon the defendant for said automobile or for the balance owing on the purchase price thereof. ... That defendant has failed and neglected to pay the plaintiff the balance of the purchase price of said car, to-wit, $768.17, or any part thereof except that on June 23rd, 1937, the said defendant paid the plaintiff the sum of $38.17 to apply as part payment on said car, leaving a net balance of $730.00, which is now past due, owing, payable, and unpaid. ... \"There is a similar allegation as to the second count of the complaint. Respondent apparently adopted the view that the action was upon the contract, as his pleadings are based on a theory beyond formal denial of conversion and contain allegations of matters by way of avoidance of the terms of the contract set up in appellant's complaint.</p>\n<p> A closely parallel case is presented in Cass v. Ocean Park Bath Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></span> [188 P. 616]. In that case the court, while observing that the complaint was bad for misjoinder of causes of action, pointed out that the defendant's remedy was by demurrer under section 430 of the Code of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> Civil Procedure and that a failure to demur constituted a waiver of the objection under section 434 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and held that the defendant had breached the contract in failing, on demand, to redeliver the goods entrusted to his care and instructed the trial court to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff. That case and the instant case proceeded to trial upon the issues joined by the complaint and answer without attack by demurrer. In this case the time draft and trust receipt were signed on the same day as part of the same transaction and preceded the delivery of the cars to the respondent.</p>\n<p> [2] Since the trust receipt came into common use as a device to facilitate the sales of automobiles, its nature has been widely discussed by the courts. The weight of opinion seems to be that a trust receipt and a time draft executed at the same time, together constitute a conditional sales contract. That view of the matter was adopted by our Appellate Court in Commercial Acceptance Trust v. Bailey, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></span> [261 P. 743]. It is apparent that the sole purpose of the two instruments, the trust receipt and the time draft, was to provide security for the payment to C. I. T. Corporation of the agreed purchase price of the vehicles delivered to Hawley. The function of the time draft is apparently to fix the time when the obligation should be paid. The sale price of each car is fixed in the trust receipt-time draft. The two instruments were unquestionably made parts of one transaction and should be considered together. Under this interpretation, the transaction was more than the ordinary trust agreement and the relationship was not that of trustor and trustee as ordinarily understood.</p>\n<p> [3] Respondent next contends that the contract resulting from the execution and delivery of the time draft and trust receipt to the appellant and the delivery of the cars to the respondent was rescinded by agreement and the court so found. Appellant claims that the evidence was wholly insufficient to support any such conclusion of law. The trial court found that \"while said so-called trust receipt was in full force and effect and before any breach thereof, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into an oral agreement that the same be waived, abandoned and rescinded as to the automobile described ... and that the same was then and there so mutually waived, abandoned and rescinded between the parties. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> ... That the plaintiff consented to the change in possession of the two automobiles referred to in the plaintiff's complaint and thus waived the terms of said trust receipt and is estopped to claim said automobiles or the proceeds thereof from the defendant.\"</p>\n<p> As to the second count, it is agreed that the truck was delivered to respondent under the written trust receipt-time draft. Possession of the truck was given to Calexico Motors by respondent. The only evidence supporting respondent's contention and the court's finding that the parties entered into an oral agreement that the trust receipt-time draft was rescinded and waived for the reason that appellant was estopped from denying that possession of the truck was transferred to the Calexico Motors without its consent, was the fact of its knowledge of the possession being in the Calexico Motors when it was checked by the agent of appellant and he observed alterations being made thereon in the place of business of Calexico Motors. We are thoroughly convinced that this evidence falls short of supporting the finding that the parties mutually agreed that a rescission of the trust receipt-time draft was thereby effected. The mere knowledge of the presence of the truck at the Calexico Motors under the circumstances related would not operate as an estoppel as found by the court. The trust receipt-time draft did not preclude respondent from giving possession of the truck to any of his agents in Imperial Valley. Appellants at all times treated the truck as in the possession of respondent, as disclosed by their checking sheet record.</p>\n<p> [4] An estoppel may arise from silence as well as from words or conduct. But this is only where there is a duty to speak, and where the party upon whom such duty rests has an opportunity to speak, and, knowing that the circumstances require him to speak, remains silent. The circumstances attending the entire transaction must be such as to make it reasonably probable that the person seeking to set up the estoppel has suffered prejudice by the other's unreasonable acquiescence. There must be something wilful or culpable in the silence. (Eltinge v. Santos, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></span> [152 P. 915, Ann. Cas. 1917A, 1143]; Stern v.

Proc., sec. 1962, subd. 3.) For the reasons expressed, the judgment as to the second count of necessity must be reversed. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span></p>\n<p> [5] The Studebaker sedan described in the first cause of action of appellant's complaint was originally delivered to respondent Hawley at El Centro. Hawley apparently had it on his floor at El Centro for several weeks and then permitted it to be left with the Calexico dealer, known as Calexico Motors, with authority to sell the same. The Calexico dealer sold the sedan and did not pay either Hawley or appellant corporation.</p>\n<p> The only additional substantial fact that can be offered to support respondent's theory and the court's finding that a rescission of the trust receipt-time draft was effected must be based on a telephone conversation. The testimony of respondent Hawley in relation thereto was as follows: \"Q. (By Mr. Childers.) That conversation was with Mr. Schrader, or whoever it was you talked to? A. I immediately called C. I. T. after having been requested to deliver the cars to Calexico by Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Schrader O.K.'d, or told me that I might deliver them to Mr. Jenkins to take to Calexico Motors. Q. Who is Mr. Jenkins? A. Mr. Jenkins was the Pacific Coast representative of the Studebaker Corporation. The Court: May I ask, did you say Mr. Schrader represented C. I. T.? A. C. I. T. The Court: He is the local representative of C. I. T.? A. Yes, sir. Q. Then what did you do? A. I called Mr. Jenkins back to Calexico and it happened that it hadn't been over ten or fifteen minutes, so I called him and told him C. I. T. had O.K.'d the removal of the cars. Q. What did you next do? A. I had to leave my business, place of business where the cars were and was gone for about two hours, and when I got back the cars had been taken. Mr. Jenkins had brought a couple of drivers up.\"</p>\n<p> During the cross-examination of Hawley he testified as follows: \"Q. (By Mr. Smith): When you called Mr. Schrader, just what did you say to him and what did he say to you? A. Well, so far as the exact words are concerned, I couldn't repeat them, but I had been requested by Mr. Jenkins to let him take the cars to Calexico and I told Mr. Schrader about that request and Mr. Schrader granted the request. Q. Tell what you said in substance and what he said. A. That would be pretty hard to recall those exact words. I immediately called Mr. Jenkins back after talking to Mr. Schrader and told him the request had been granted by C. I. T. Q. Let's go back and get what was said by Mr. Schrader and what was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> said by you. A. I haven't any copy of it, all I could give you is an idea of what he said. Q. Did you tell him Mr. Jenkins the Pacific Coast factory representative wanted to take cars to Calexico? A. That is right. Q. What did he say? A. He granted that request. Q. What did he say? A. I don't remember. Q. Is that all that was said, just a short conversation? A. Just a short conversation. Q. You didn't tell him that you were going to sell the cars to Calexico Motors. A. I did not. Q. Or did you tell him whether or not the cars would be returned to El Centro? A. I did not. Q. Did you tell him that he was out of cars down there and you wanted to let him take them for a few days? A. I don't think so. Mr. Jenkins may have given some reason for taking them down there and I might have told them the reason Mr. Jenkins wanted them. Q. You had, before that time, loaned them cars without selling them, to let them have to show in their show room? A. On the opening Mr. Jenkins made the same request. Q. On that occasion you just loaned them and brought them back? A. I think most of them were returned. I am pretty sure one sold down there and they paid C. I. T. for it.\"</p>\n<p> The testimony of Mr. Schrader, the agent for C. I. T. Corporation, regarding the telephone conversation was as follows: \"Q. (By Mr. Smith): Mr. Schrader, you are the El Centro manager of C. I. T.? A. Yes, sir. Q. And do you recall a telephone conversation with Mr. Hawley on or about the latter part of May, 1937, in which he asked something about Mr. Jenkins wanting a car to take to Calexico Motors? A. I do. ... Q. What did he say to you and what did you say to him in that conversation? A. Hawley called up and asked for permission to take the cars down to Calexico Motors and he wanted to get my O. K. Q. What did you say? A. I said, 'If you are going to do that, Hawley, you should go ahead and change title to floor in the name of Calexico Motors like we handled it previously,' and he said, 'No, it is going to be down there for a few days, and in their storage, where and just as a loan, and it will be returned,' and I said, 'You do so at your own risk,' because, after all, it is floored in Mr. Hawley. So he took it down, and the next thing I knew, the cars were there. ... Q. You have no agreement with him as to where he could store cars, did you? A. No, he could store them anywhere he wanted to.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span></p>\n<p> From this conversation as given by both Hawley and Schrader, it is quite apparent that Hawley never did say anything to Schrader which would lead Schrader or the C. I. T. Corporation to believe that Hawley expected to be relieved of the obligation of paying for or accounting for the truck and automobile.</p>\n<p> One of appellant's witnesses testified on cross-examination, in reference to how Hawley handled similar transactions when sales were effected by one of his subdealers, as follows: \"Q. (By Mr. Smith): Explain now. A. Mr. Hawley, as distributor for Imperial County for passenger cars, would have his own stock of cars in his possession on which he had a flooring arrangement for them with C. I. T. If he wanted to sell a car to one of his subdealers he would call C. I. T. to find out if that subdealer had a line of credit with us and could agree to pay cash to him. The subdealer would come in and take possession of the car and the two of them, sometimes one of them separately, would come to our office and sign a trust receipt for the new dealer and Mr. Hawley would sign a bill of sale passing title, selling it for the full price to this dealer. ... Q. That was never done with these two cars? A. It was never asked of us. He had done it on other occasions with the Calexico Motors, ...\"</p>\n<p> In addition to this, respondent offered in evidence an invoice in which he charged the sedan and the truck to the Calexico dealer. It reads in part as follows:</p>\n<p> \"VALENS OIL CO.\"</p>\n<p> \"Independently Owned by\"</p>\n<p> J. H. HAWLEY ...</p>\n<p> \"Sold to Calexico Motors. ...\"</p>\n<p> \"1 St. Regis Sedan...$818.60\"</p>\n<p> \"FOR RESALE Delivered by J. H. H. ...\"</p>\n<p> Also dated \"6-24-1937\" and entitled as above:</p>\n<p> \"1 1-1/2 ton truck $850.00\"</p>\n<p> \"... FOR RESALE Delivered by JHH.\"</p>\n<p> By this invoice the intentions of respondent became quite apparent. If the two vehicles in question had been billed and an invoice sent by C. I. T. Corporation to the Calexico dealer, then there would be some force to respondent's argument <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> that C. I. T. Corporation had abandoned and waived its contract with him and had agreed to look to Calexico Motors for payment, but by the invoice mentioned, respondent personally billed the Calexico dealer with the two vehicles for money due Mr. Hawley. That act certainly was not consistent with his present argument that C. I. T. Corporation had waived and abandoned Hawley's written obligation. Appellant Hawley recognized his obligation to C. I. T. Corporation after the Calexico dealer had disposed of the sedan and the truck by making payments on these contracts to C. I. T. Corporation. There is no dispute that the payments were made several weeks after the cars had been taken to the Calexico dealer and even after they had been sold by the Calexico dealer and after he had absconded. Respondent never denied his obligations to appellant until after suit was filed.</p>\n<p> [6] It is claimed by respondent that the payments were made under threat of suit and the trial court allowed a recovery of the amount so paid. It is not legal duress to threaten to or actually take advantage of the usual remedy by suit for the enforcement of a debt or obligation. (Holt v. Thomas, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></span> [38 P. 891]; Burke v.

We note in reading the transcript of the evidence that two Studebaker sedans were taken to the Calexico dealer on the day of the telephone conversation and that Hawley himself later went to Calexico and brought one of the sedans back to El Centro where he, Hawley, sold it. Respondent does not contend that there was any other act, written document, or oral conversation which relieved him of his responsibility except the telephone conversation mentioned. Assuming the correctness of the telephone conversation as represented by respondent, we are unable to accept the finding that this evidence sufficiently supported the ruling that the facts related amounted to a rescission, waiver and abandonment of the contract between appellant and respondent. Consent is not mutual, unless the parties all agree upon the same thing in the same sense. (Sec. 1580, Civ. Code.) From the foregoing, it is plain that there never was a meeting of the minds to abandon or rescind the obligations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> of respondent. (Western Oil etc. Co. v.

Comparet for Respondent.</p>\n<p> Barnard, P. J.</p>\n<p> This is an action for the recovery of secret profits claimed to have been made by the defendants through a real estate transaction. A jury brought in a verdict for $11,000 in favor of the plaintiff and the defendants have appealed from the ensuing judgment. The defendant R. E. Harrison, who will be referred to as the appellant, was a real estate agent in San Diego and practically the sole owner of two corporations named R. E. Harrison Co. and Rae Investment Company.</p>\n<p> The respondent, who resided in Ohio, had met the appellant, during a visit to San Diego in 1921. On April 10, 1922, the appellant sent a telegram to the respondent, saying he had just obtained a 30-day contract on the Otay ranch, consisting of 7,000 acres, praising its investment possibilities and asking the respondent to buy it. About that time the appellant contracted to purchase from a Mr. Judson about 6,360 acres of land known as the Otay ranch, and by a separate contract agreed to purchase from Judson an additional 1,000 acres which adjoined the Otay ranch. Both parcels were thereafter frequently referred to by the parties as the \"Otay Ranch\". On April 1, 1922, Judson deeded the 1,000 acres to the Rae Investment Company and on June 2, 1922, he deeded the 6,360 acres to R. E. Harrison Co. In each instance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*291</span> the grantee company executed a mortgage to secure the balance of the purchase price, and the deeds and mortgages were all recorded. The purchase price for both tracts was $155,000. The appellant took possession of the property in September, 1922, made certain improvements thereon and leased portions thereof to various tenants, who placed about 2,500 acres under cultivation. The appellant loaned certain amounts to several of the tenants, taking back crop mortgages, which were recorded. He also placed signs at the four entrances to the ranch and smaller signs at intervals around the boundary thereof, warning against trespassing, which signs contained the words: \"Otay Ranch, R. E. Harrison Co., Owners\".</p>\n<p> During the latter part of February, 1923, the respondent came to San Diego and was taken over the ranch by the appellant. On March 2, 1923, he was given an option reading, in part, as follows:</p>\n<p> \"For and in consideration of the sum of One ($1.00) Dollar to me in hand paid, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, I hereby give to H. J. Adams of Fostoria, Ohio, the option to purchase from me within thirty (30) days from this date an undivided one-half (1/2) interest in and to the Otay Rancho and the one thousand (1000) acres, more or less, belonging to me and adjoining the Otay Rancho on the north, making a total acreage of seven thousand three hundred sixty (7360) acres more or less.\"</p>\n<p> \"The purchase price of said undivided one-half (1/2) interest to be the sum of Ninety-five Thousand ($95,000.00) Dollars, payable as follows:\" (Here follows terms of payment, including a provision that the respondent was to assume one-half of the encumbrance on the property.)</p>\n<p> On April 11, 1923, the respondent exercised this option and on June 13, 1923, a one-half interest in these lands was conveyed to him and the appellant wrote him saying, \"I am this day deeding to you an undivided one-half interest in the Otay Rancho, consisting of 6360 acres, and 1000 acres, more or less\".</p>\n<p> About the time this option was given the parties were negotiating for the purchase of another tract of 3,435 acres, known as the National ranch, which is not directly involved in this action. On March 6, 1923, the appellant sent a letter to the respondent at Los Angeles in which he said: \"I have got everything signed on the dotted line this afternoon. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*292</span> After whittling everything down to the last dollar I find that the tract will cost approximately $78,250.00. I made Jones come through with some of his commission -- therefore this price. I have got everything in escrow and will have the deed within a very few days. I am taking it in my name and then will redeed you a half interest. There will be approximately 3435 acres.\" He further asked the respondent to send him $10,000, stated that he would let him know in a few days the exact amount of the respondent's \"pro-rata\" share of the cost, and that on the next day he would send him \"a contract for us between ourselves\". The next day the appellant sent the respondent a contract setting forth that \"I hereby agree to deliver to Henry J. Adams of Fostoria, Ohio, an undivided one-half interest in and to\", followed by a description of the property, providing that the full purchase price for said undivided one-half interest was to be $39,125.00, and providing for terms of payment.</p>\n<p> From and after April 11, 1923, the ranch properties were operated by the respondent and the appellant as partners, the latter being in active charge. Trouble arose between them in 1925. After two agreements had been entered into in an attempt to adjust their affairs a final agreement was executed on April 8, 1926, as a result of which the appellant got the Otay ranch and the respondent got the National ranch.</p>\n<p> It appears, without conflict, that the appellant, as above stated, paid $155,000 for the Otay ranch and charged the respondent $95,000 for a one-half interest therein, and that he represented the cost of the National ranch to be $78,250, when in fact the purchase price was $51,500. The National ranch transaction is not directly involved here and the appellant contends, with respect to the Otay ranch, that he was dealing with respondent at arm's length, that he had owned the Otay ranch for about a year prior to the present transaction, that he had a legal right to sell a one-half interest to the respondent at a profit, and that no partnership relationship existed between them until after that sale had been made, when they became partners in the operation of the ranch. The respondent contends, on the other hand, that the case is one where a secret profit was obtained by one partner or joint adventurer through taking advantage of the other. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*293</span></p>\n<p> [1] The first point raised is that there is a fatal variance between the allegations of the complaint and the proof. The complaint is one for money had and received. A demurrer was overruled and the appellant answered denying the allegations of the complaint and setting up as a separate defense that the cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations. A bill of particulars was demanded and the one furnished stated that the amount sued for was received on or about March 2, 1923, and that the circumstances under which the appellant received the money were \"in connection with the purchase from C. S. Judson of a tract of land located in San Diego County, California, known as the Otay Ranch\". The appellant contends that the complaint which was filed on May 15, 1937, contained no allegation of fraud, fraudulent representation, or of a secret profit, and further, that although the bill of particulars discloses that the cause of action, which is based upon fraud, arose more than three years before the complaint was filed, the complaint contained no allegations showing when the fraud was discovered or giving facts and circumstances justifying the delay in bringing the action.</p>\n<p> [2] In support of this contention the appellant relies upon cases which have held that one seeking relief from a court of equity against fraud after three years have elapsed must allege in his complaint the time and circumstances of the discovery of the fraud, together with the facts relied upon as excusing an earlier discovery. (Phelps v. Grady, 168 Cal. 73 [141 P. 926]; Gibson v. Rath, 13 Cal.App.2d 40 [55 PaCal.2d 1219]; Nighbert v. First Nat. Bank of Bakersfield, 26 Cal.App.2d 624 [79 PaCal.2d 1105].) In such cases, there has been involved the sufficiency of complaints which show upon their face that three years have elapsed since the fraud was committed. Since the complaint in the instant action was in the form of a common count this fact did not appear upon its face. In such a case, a different rule prevails. (MacDonald v. Reich &amp; Lievre, Inc., 100 Cal.App. 736 [281 P. 106]; Agee v. Virden Packing Co., 15 Cal.App.2d 691 [59 PaCal.2d 1058].) In Philpott v. Superior Court, 1 Cal.2d 512 [36 PaCal.2d 635, 95 A.L.R. 990], the history and present standing of the common count for money had and received is rather thoroughly discussed. In that case the first count was based upon money paid for stock in a bank in reliance upon fraudulent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*294</span> representations, and the second count was for money had and received. The court there said: \"Under the peculiar facts in this case a judgment for plaintiff in the sum of $625, with interest and costs, would fully satisfy his demands. In short, he asks no relief that a court of law may not in all respects give him. This, of itself, would seem sufficient to deny plaintiff a place in a court of equity.\" The court quoted with approval from Clark on Contracts, as follows: \"'A frequent illustration of a quasi-contractual obligation of this kind arises where a person obtains another's money by wrongful or fraudulent means. ... He is not always restricted, however, to an action ex delicto for the specific wrong, but may in general waive the tort, and sue in assumpsit for the money as for money received for his use. ... The same is true in any case in which one person, by means of trespass, fraud, or other tortious means obtains another's money.'\" The court then held that the action was one at law. Under these authorities, we hold that the complaint in the instant action was sufficient and that there was no fatal variance between the pleading and the proof.</p>\n<p> [3] It is next contended that the evidence is not sufficient to support the judgment. Among other things, the respondent testified as follows:</p>\n<p> \"A. He stated he wanted me to go in with him on the purchase of the Otay and National Ranches on a 50-50 basis and at a figure, I was to put up the same amount he was to put up on both properties, in the National and the Otay--property which he stated belonged to Mr. Judson. Q. Did he during these conversations tell you what he was paying for these ranches or what he could get them for? A. He did. Q. Did he say what the basis of your relationship would be after they were purchased? A. We would be joint adventurers, partners in all of the transactions we may go into. Q. Did he say that before you entered into the deal? A. He did. Q. What did he tell you was the cost of the Otay Ranch? A. He said he could get the Otay and one thousand acres adjoining which we always called the Otay, at $190,000; certain payments down and the rest spread over quite a considerable period.\"</p>\n<p> And again:</p>\n<p> \"Q. What did he say with respect to what your relationship would be? A. He said that we would buy the Otay and parts of the National Ranches in partnership, and we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*295</span> would both put up equal sums of money for the partnership and joint adventure, the two deals we were figuring on, on both the Otay and parts of the National Ranch. Q. Did these transactions take place before there was any transaction between you? A. They took place before, in regard to the purchase, and many times after we made a deal.\"</p>\n<p> It is contended that on or about March 1, 1923, when this conversation was had, there was no confidential relation between the parties and that the respondent's cause of action is based entirely upon his claim that when he entered into the transaction he did not know that the appellant was the owner of the property, but believed that he and the appellant were then buying the property from Judson for the price of $190,000. It is then argued that the respondent could not have so believed; that the option itself disclosed on its face that it was an option to purchase from the appellant lands belonging to him; that in the letter of June 13, 1923, the appellant told the respondent \"I am this day deeding to you an undivided one-half interest in the Otay Rancho\"; that the deed itself was from R. E. Harrison Co.; that the signs on the ranch showed the same thing; that the respondent had seen a certificate of title disclosing the appellant's ownership; and that a certain witness testified that early in 1923 the respondent told him the appellant had purchased the land from Judson.</p>\n<p> Much of the evidence thus referred to was denied by the respondent. It must be conceded that portions of the evidence justify the inference that respondent should have known that the appellant had already purchased at least a part of these lands from Judson. There are some facts, however, justifying a contrary inference. The appellant was a real estate agent and had tried to sell the entire property to the respondent in April, 1922, when he said he had obtained a 30-day contract, apparently in the nature of a listing agreement. If it be assumed that the respondent saw the signs on the ranch naming R. E. Harrison Co. as the owner, he may have thought that the appellant's original 30-day contract had been extended but not known that an actual sale had been consummated, especially in view of the appellant's efforts to get him to purchase a half interest in the property. It should be noted in this connection that the option itself stated that the 1,000 acres adjoining the Otay ranch belonged to the appellant, but made no such statement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*296</span> with reference to the other 6,360 acres. It appears that from the beginning the parties were negotiating not only for the purchase and sale of a one-half interest in the Otay ranch but for the purchase, by the two together, of the National ranch. In his letter of March 6, 1923, the appellant told the respondent he was then buying the National ranch for the respondent and himself, that he had not yet received the contract, that this property \"will cost\" $78,000, and that \"I am taking it in my name and will then redeed you a half interest.\" In the same letter, he said: \"Hoping you will find everything satisfactory and that our mutual interests will never be marred, and that we will each make a 'killing' on our proposition.\" The proposition and the mutual interests mentioned in this letter may well have been taken by the respondent to refer to both parts of the deal, that is the purchase of both the National and Otay ranches. When the appellant wrote to the respondent on June 13th, saying \"I am this day deeding to you a one-half interest in the Otay Rancho,\" the respondent may have thought that part of the deal was being handled the way the National ranch had been handled, namely, \"I am taking it in my name and then will redeed you a half interest.\" We are pointed to no evidence that the respondent was ever told that the appellant had actually purchased the Otay ranch about a year earlier, and it would not have been entirely unreasonable for the respondent to have thought that the two deals were being handled in a similar manner.</p>\n<p> However, if it be conceded that the respondent knew or ought to have known that the appellant had previously purchased the Otay ranch from Judson, that fact is not conclusive. The gist of respondent's cause of action is not that the appellant deceived him with respect to who then owned the ranch, but that he had agreed to sell him a one-half interest in the Otay ranch for what that interest would cost or had cost the appellant; in other words, that it was agreed that each should pay the same amount for his interest in the land. [4] While, as the appellant argues, one may sell his own property to another without disclosing what he himself paid, he may not agree that the other shall become owner of a half interest by paying one-half of the cost of the property and then, by representing that the cost was greater than it was, deceive the other and obtain from him more than he should have paid. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*297</span></p>\n<p> The appellant argues that no confidential relationship existed until the respondent exercised the option and agreed to take an interest in the property on April 13, 1923, and, therefore, that he was under no obligation to give the true facts to the respondent when the conversations were had on or about the first of March. Those conversations and the acts of the parties over a period of six weeks led directly to the transaction here in question. It clearly appears that the primary purpose of both parties was to obtain the land for speculative purposes. It also appears that the appellant was confronted with financial difficulties in holding the land and that he desired the respondent's assistance. While the appellant insists that there was no partnership between him and the respondent, except later in connection with the operation of the land, the evidence justifies the inference that they went into partnership for the purpose of either buying or holding the land. It matters little, however, whether the arrangement was technically a partnership or a joint adventure. The material and controlling element is whether the respondent entered into the transaction upon the representation and with the understanding that each was to pay the same amount and that they were to share the cost of the ranch whether past or future. If, in fact, there was an agreement that this cost was to be shared equally there was a sufficient confidential relationship between the parties to require the appellant to disclose the true facts with respect to the cost of the land, regardless of the exact date upon which the formation of a partnership was consummated, or a joint adventure begun.</p>\n<p> There is no question that such an arrangement was made with respect to the National ranch, which was purchased from Judson after the parties hereto had begun their negotiations, about March 1, 1923. The parties were then negotiating for the sale to the respondent of a half interest in both the Otay and National ranches, a total of about 11,000 acres. In his letter of March 6th, the appellant referred to their \"mutual interests\" and expressed the hope that they would \"each make a 'killing' on our proposition\". At that time the respondent had not agreed to buy an interest in either the Otay ranch or the National ranch, and he may well have taken a portion of this letter as relating to the purchase of both ranches and to their mutual interests in the entire proposition involved in their previous conversations. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*298</span> evidence supports the finding and conclusion that his purchase of a half interest in the Otay ranch was to be, like that of the National ranch, on a 50-50 basis, each party to pay an equal share of the cost of the land. The appellant required the respondent to pay to him one-half of the amounts he had advanced to tenants upon the land. Many of the circumstances shown by the evidence indicate that the respondent was justified in understanding and believing that he was purchasing a one-half interest in the Otay ranch by paying one-half of the cost thereof to the appellant, and that such cost was to be shared equally by them. While there is considerable conflicting evidence the question was one of fact for the jury, and its finding thereon is not without support.</p>\n<p> [5] It is next contended that it appears as a matter of law that the action was barred by the statute of limitations and that the evidence conclusively shows that the respondent, as a reasonable man, was put upon inquiry, that means of knowledge were open to him, and that a reasonable inquiry would have developed the true facts. A large part of this argument is devoted to the proposition that information was available which would have disclosed that the appellant had actually purchased the Otay ranch in 1922. In addition to what we have already said on this subject it should be remembered that the respondent lived in Ohio, that the transaction was closed by mail, and that the respondent was in San Diego very little for some years thereafter. The important consideration is whether circumstances existed which put the respondent upon his guard with respect to the action of the appellant in charging him more than his proportion of what the land had cost, and whether means of knowledge were open to the respondent which, if pursued, would have disclosed the true facts in that regard. The appellant relies upon the fact that trouble developed between the parties in 1925 and 1926 over the management of the ranch and the payment of existing obligations, which led to an agreement separating their interests, and which left the parties with considerable ill-will toward each other. There was some evidence that the respondent, after that time, told certain parties that the appellant had defrauded him in connection with the settlement of their affairs. Not only is that evidence contradicted by the testimony of the respondent but knowledge of wrongdoing on the part of the appellant in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*299</span> that connection could hardly be said, as a matter of law, to have put the respondent upon notice and to have required him to make an investigation as to the acts of the appellant in originally entering into the transaction.</p>\n<p> Moreover, it does not appear that means of knowledge were then open to the respondent or that any reasonable inquiry on his part would have developed the true facts with respect to the real fraud, which is here in issue. It appears that after he had received an intimation of this fraud, in 1936, the respondent went to Judson, from whom the land had been purchased, to Judson's attorney and to the real estate agent who had represented Judson, all of whom refused to give him any information on that subject. It does not appear that an earlier inquiry would have been more successful, and it is not to be anticipated that the appellant would have been any more helpful had an inquiry been made of him. While there is a great deal of evidence upon this subject, the only thing that clearly appears therefrom is that it is sharply conflicting in the respect now under consideration. From the record before us it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that the action was barred or that sufficient excuse was not shown for a failure to make an earlier discovery of the true facts. Again the question was one of fact for the jury. It may be said here as was said in Victor Oil Co. v. Drum, 184 Cal. 226 [193 P. 243]:</p>\n<p> \"Without some information which carried a direct implication or suggestion of possible fraud, the plaintiff could not be put upon inquiry. The courts will not lightly seize upon some small circumstance to deny relief to a party plainly shown to have been actually defrauded against those who defrauded him on the ground, forsooth, that he did not discover the fact that he had been cheated as soon as he might have done. It is only where the party defrauded should plainly have discovered the fraud except for his own inexcusable inattention that he will be charged with a discovery in advance of actual knowledge on his part. The present case is not of that character.\"</p>\n<p> [6] The next points raised are that the court erred in excluding testimony as to the value of this land and in refusing to instruct the jury to the effect that the measure of the respondent's damages, if any, would be the difference between the money he paid for the property and the value of the property he received. It is argued that since the action <span class=\"star-pagination\">*300</span> was in fact based upon fraudulent representations the measure of damages is fixed by section 3343 of the Civil Code. That section has no application in this case where, in the manner pointed out in Philpott v. Superior Court, supra, the respondent waived the tort and sued for the return of his money. In such an action the actual value of the land is not material and has nothing to do with the amount which the plaintiff has paid and which he seeks to have returned. (King v. Wise, 43 Cal. 628; Fink v. Weisman, 129 Cal.App. 305 [18 PaCal.2d 961].)</p>\n<p> [7] It is next urged that the court erred in admitting evidence concerning the sale of an interest in the National ranch to the respondent. While it is conceded that this evidence disclosed that the appellant had secured a secret profit in that deal it is argued that it was an entirely separate transaction and that evidence of a prior or subsequent fraud is not admissible. Not only was this evidence admissible for the purpose of showing intent (Atkins Corporation v. Tourny, 6 Cal.2d 206 [57 PaCal.2d 480]; Evans v. Gibson, 220 Cal. 476 [31 PaCal.2d 389]), but it had a direct relation to the entire transaction and was admissible to prove the existence of a confidential relationship between the parties at that time and before the option for the purchase of the Otay ranch was exercised by the respondent. [8] It is further urged that the court erred in excluding evidence of public knowledge of the fact that the Otay ranch was owned by the defendant. The only thing referred to in this connection is that the court excluded an article supposed to have appeared in a newspaper published in San Diego. This article was published while the respondent was in Ohio, it did not show that the appellant owned the land in question, and a great deal of other evidence was admitted by the court for the purpose of showing such public knowledge. No reversible error appears in this connection.</p>\n<p> [9] Some contention is made that the differences between the parties were completely adjusted by the contracts of settlement which finally resulted, in 1936, in the appellant taking back the Otay ranch. That settlement had nothing to do with the original transaction here in question, and the facts upon which this action is based were not then known to the respondent. In so far as shown by the evidence, that settlement purported to settle certain matters between the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*301</span> parties and made no pretense of settling all of their differences or affairs.</p>\n<p> The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p> Griffin, J., and Haines, J., pro tem., concurred.</p>\n</div>","html_columbia":null,"html_with_citations":"<div>\n<center><b><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Comparet for Respondent.</p>\n<p> Barnard, P. J.</p>\n<p> This is an action for the recovery of secret profits claimed to have been made by the defendants through a real estate transaction. A jury brought in a verdict for $11,000 in favor of the plaintiff and the defendants have appealed from the ensuing judgment. The defendant R. E. Harrison, who will be referred to as the appellant, was a real estate agent in San Diego and practically the sole owner of two corporations named R. E. Harrison Co. and Rae Investment Company.</p>\n<p> The respondent, who resided in Ohio, had met the appellant, during a visit to San Diego in 1921. On April 10, 1922, the appellant sent a telegram to the respondent, saying he had just obtained a 30-day contract on the Otay ranch, consisting of 7,000 acres, praising its investment possibilities and asking the respondent to buy it. About that time the appellant contracted to purchase from a Mr. Judson about 6,360 acres of land known as the Otay ranch, and by a separate contract agreed to purchase from Judson an additional 1,000 acres which adjoined the Otay ranch. Both parcels were thereafter frequently referred to by the parties as the \"Otay Ranch\". On April 1, 1922, Judson deeded the 1,000 acres to the Rae Investment Company and on June 2, 1922, he deeded the 6,360 acres to R. E. Harrison Co. In each instance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*291</span> the grantee company executed a mortgage to secure the balance of the purchase price, and the deeds and mortgages were all recorded. The purchase price for both tracts was $155,000. The appellant took possession of the property in September, 1922, made certain improvements thereon and leased portions thereof to various tenants, who placed about 2,500 acres under cultivation. The appellant loaned certain amounts to several of the tenants, taking back crop mortgages, which were recorded. He also placed signs at the four entrances to the ranch and smaller signs at intervals around the boundary thereof, warning against trespassing, which signs contained the words: \"Otay Ranch, R. E. Harrison Co., Owners\".</p>\n<p> During the latter part of February, 1923, the respondent came to San Diego and was taken over the ranch by the appellant. On March 2, 1923, he was given an option reading, in part, as follows:</p>\n<p> \"For and in consideration of the sum of One ($1.00) Dollar to me in hand paid, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, I hereby give to H. J. Adams of Fostoria, Ohio, the option to purchase from me within thirty (30) days from this date an undivided one-half (1/2) interest in and to the Otay Rancho and the one thousand (1000) acres, more or less, belonging to me and adjoining the Otay Rancho on the north, making a total acreage of seven thousand three hundred sixty (7360) acres more or less.\"</p>\n<p> \"The purchase price of said undivided one-half (1/2) interest to be the sum of Ninety-five Thousand ($95,000.00) Dollars, payable as follows:\" (Here follows terms of payment, including a provision that the respondent was to assume one-half of the encumbrance on the property.)</p>\n<p> On April 11, 1923, the respondent exercised this option and on June 13, 1923, a one-half interest in these lands was conveyed to him and the appellant wrote him saying, \"I am this day deeding to you an undivided one-half interest in the Otay Rancho, consisting of 6360 acres, and 1000 acres, more or less\".</p>\n<p> About the time this option was given the parties were negotiating for the purchase of another tract of 3,435 acres, known as the National ranch, which is not directly involved in this action. On March 6, 1923, the appellant sent a letter to the respondent at Los Angeles in which he said: \"I have got everything signed on the dotted line this afternoon. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*292</span> After whittling everything down to the last dollar I find that the tract will cost approximately $78,250.00. I made Jones come through with some of his commission -- therefore this price. I have got everything in escrow and will have the deed within a very few days. I am taking it in my name and then will redeed you a half interest. There will be approximately 3435 acres.\" He further asked the respondent to send him $10,000, stated that he would let him know in a few days the exact amount of the respondent's \"pro-rata\" share of the cost, and that on the next day he would send him \"a contract for us between ourselves\". The next day the appellant sent the respondent a contract setting forth that \"I hereby agree to deliver to Henry J. Adams of Fostoria, Ohio, an undivided one-half interest in and to\", followed by a description of the property, providing that the full purchase price for said undivided one-half interest was to be $39,125.00, and providing for terms of payment.</p>\n<p> From and after April 11, 1923, the ranch properties were operated by the respondent and the appellant as partners, the latter being in active charge. Trouble arose between them in 1925. After two agreements had been entered into in an attempt to adjust their affairs a final agreement was executed on April 8, 1926, as a result of which the appellant got the Otay ranch and the respondent got the National ranch.</p>\n<p> It appears, without conflict, that the appellant, as above stated, paid $155,000 for the Otay ranch and charged the respondent $95,000 for a one-half interest therein, and that he represented the cost of the National ranch to be $78,250, when in fact the purchase price was $51,500. The National ranch transaction is not directly involved here and the appellant contends, with respect to the Otay ranch, that he was dealing with respondent at arm's length, that he had owned the Otay ranch for about a year prior to the present transaction, that he had a legal right to sell a one-half interest to the respondent at a profit, and that no partnership relationship existed between them until after that sale had been made, when they became partners in the operation of the ranch. The respondent contends, on the other hand, that the case is one where a secret profit was obtained by one partner or joint adventurer through taking advantage of the other. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*293</span></p>\n<p> [1] The first point raised is that there is a fatal variance between the allegations of the complaint and the proof. The complaint is one for money had and received. A demurrer was overruled and the appellant answered denying the allegations of the complaint and setting up as a separate defense that the cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations. A bill of particulars was demanded and the one furnished stated that the amount sued for was received on or about March 2, 1923, and that the circumstances under which the appellant received the money were \"in connection with the purchase from C. S. Judson of a tract of land located in San Diego County, California, known as the Otay Ranch\". The appellant contends that the complaint which was filed on May 15, 1937, contained no allegation of fraud, fraudulent representation, or of a secret profit, and further, that although the bill of particulars discloses that the cause of action, which is based upon fraud, arose more than three years before the complaint was filed, the complaint contained no allegations showing when the fraud was discovered or giving facts and circumstances justifying the delay in bringing the action.</p>\n<p> [2] In support of this contention the appellant relies upon cases which have held that one seeking relief from a court of equity against fraud after three years have elapsed must allege in his complaint the time and circumstances of the discovery of the fraud, together with the facts relied upon as excusing an earlier discovery. (Phelps v. Grady, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></span> [141 P. 926]; Gibson v.

In such cases, there has been involved the sufficiency of complaints which show upon their face that three years have elapsed since the fraud was committed. Since the complaint in the instant action was in the form of a common count this fact did not appear upon its face. In such a case, a different rule prevails. (MacDonald v. Reich &amp; Lievre, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">736</span></span> [281 P. 106]; Agee v.

In that case the first count was based upon money paid for stock in a bank in reliance upon fraudulent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*294</span> representations, and the second count was for money had and received. The court there said: \"Under the peculiar facts in this case a judgment for plaintiff in the sum of $625, with interest and costs, would fully satisfy his demands. In short, he asks no relief that a court of law may not in all respects give him. This, of itself, would seem sufficient to deny plaintiff a place in a court of equity.\" The court quoted with approval from Clark on Contracts, as follows: \"'A frequent illustration of a quasi-contractual obligation of this kind arises where a person obtains another's money by wrongful or fraudulent means. ... He is not always restricted, however, to an action ex delicto for the specific wrong, but may in general waive the tort, and sue in assumpsit for the money as for money received for his use. ... The same is true in any case in which one person, by means of trespass, fraud, or other tortious means obtains another's money.'\" The court then held that the action was one at law. Under these authorities, we hold that the complaint in the instant action was sufficient and that there was no fatal variance between the pleading and the proof.</p>\n<p> [3] It is next contended that the evidence is not sufficient to support the judgment. Among other things, the respondent testified as follows:</p>\n<p> \"A. He stated he wanted me to go in with him on the purchase of the Otay and National Ranches on a 50-50 basis and at a figure, I was to put up the same amount he was to put up on both properties, in the National and the Otay--property which he stated belonged to Mr. Judson. Q. Did he during these conversations tell you what he was paying for these ranches or what he could get them for? A. He did. Q. Did he say what the basis of your relationship would be after they were purchased? A. We would be joint adventurers, partners in all of the transactions we may go into. Q. Did he say that before you entered into the deal? A. He did. Q. What did he tell you was the cost of the Otay Ranch? A. He said he could get the Otay and one thousand acres adjoining which we always called the Otay, at $190,000; certain payments down and the rest spread over quite a considerable period.\"</p>\n<p> And again:</p>\n<p> \"Q. What did he say with respect to what your relationship would be? A. He said that we would buy the Otay and parts of the National Ranches in partnership, and we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*295</span> would both put up equal sums of money for the partnership and joint adventure, the two deals we were figuring on, on both the Otay and parts of the National Ranch. Q. Did these transactions take place before there was any transaction between you? A. They took place before, in regard to the purchase, and many times after we made a deal.\"</p>\n<p> It is contended that on or about March 1, 1923, when this conversation was had, there was no confidential relation between the parties and that the respondent's cause of action is based entirely upon his claim that when he entered into the transaction he did not know that the appellant was the owner of the property, but believed that he and the appellant were then buying the property from Judson for the price of $190,000. It is then argued that the respondent could not have so believed; that the option itself disclosed on its face that it was an option to purchase from the appellant lands belonging to him; that in the letter of June 13, 1923, the appellant told the respondent \"I am this day deeding to you an undivided one-half interest in the Otay Rancho\"; that the deed itself was from R. E. Harrison Co.; that the signs on the ranch showed the same thing; that the respondent had seen a certificate of title disclosing the appellant's ownership; and that a certain witness testified that early in 1923 the respondent told him the appellant had purchased the land from Judson.</p>\n<p> Much of the evidence thus referred to was denied by the respondent. It must be conceded that portions of the evidence justify the inference that respondent should have known that the appellant had already purchased at least a part of these lands from Judson. There are some facts, however, justifying a contrary inference. The appellant was a real estate agent and had tried to sell the entire property to the respondent in April, 1922, when he said he had obtained a 30-day contract, apparently in the nature of a listing agreement. If it be assumed that the respondent saw the signs on the ranch naming R. E. Harrison Co. as the owner, he may have thought that the appellant's original 30-day contract had been extended but not known that an actual sale had been consummated, especially in view of the appellant's efforts to get him to purchase a half interest in the property. It should be noted in this connection that the option itself stated that the 1,000 acres adjoining the Otay ranch belonged to the appellant, but made no such statement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*296</span> with reference to the other 6,360 acres. It appears that from the beginning the parties were negotiating not only for the purchase and sale of a one-half interest in the Otay ranch but for the purchase, by the two together, of the National ranch. In his letter of March 6, 1923, the appellant told the respondent he was then buying the National ranch for the respondent and himself, that he had not yet received the contract, that this property \"will cost\" $78,000, and that \"I am taking it in my name and will then redeed you a half interest.\" In the same letter, he said: \"Hoping you will find everything satisfactory and that our mutual interests will never be marred, and that we will each make a 'killing' on our proposition.\" The proposition and the mutual interests mentioned in this letter may well have been taken by the respondent to refer to both parts of the deal, that is the purchase of both the National and Otay ranches. When the appellant wrote to the respondent on June 13th, saying \"I am this day deeding to you a one-half interest in the Otay Rancho,\" the respondent may have thought that part of the deal was being handled the way the National ranch had been handled, namely, \"I am taking it in my name and then will redeed you a half interest.\" We are pointed to no evidence that the respondent was ever told that the appellant had actually purchased the Otay ranch about a year earlier, and it would not have been entirely unreasonable for the respondent to have thought that the two deals were being handled in a similar manner.</p>\n<p> However, if it be conceded that the respondent knew or ought to have known that the appellant had previously purchased the Otay ranch from Judson, that fact is not conclusive. The gist of respondent's cause of action is not that the appellant deceived him with respect to who then owned the ranch, but that he had agreed to sell him a one-half interest in the Otay ranch for what that interest would cost or had cost the appellant; in other words, that it was agreed that each should pay the same amount for his interest in the land. [4] While, as the appellant argues, one may sell his own property to another without disclosing what he himself paid, he may not agree that the other shall become owner of a half interest by paying one-half of the cost of the property and then, by representing that the cost was greater than it was, deceive the other and obtain from him more than he should have paid. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*297</span></p>\n<p> The appellant argues that no confidential relationship existed until the respondent exercised the option and agreed to take an interest in the property on April 13, 1923, and, therefore, that he was under no obligation to give the true facts to the respondent when the conversations were had on or about the first of March. Those conversations and the acts of the parties over a period of six weeks led directly to the transaction here in question. It clearly appears that the primary purpose of both parties was to obtain the land for speculative purposes. It also appears that the appellant was confronted with financial difficulties in holding the land and that he desired the respondent's assistance. While the appellant insists that there was no partnership between him and the respondent, except later in connection with the operation of the land, the evidence justifies the inference that they went into partnership for the purpose of either buying or holding the land. It matters little, however, whether the arrangement was technically a partnership or a joint adventure. The material and controlling element is whether the respondent entered into the transaction upon the representation and with the understanding that each was to pay the same amount and that they were to share the cost of the ranch whether past or future. If, in fact, there was an agreement that this cost was to be shared equally there was a sufficient confidential relationship between the parties to require the appellant to disclose the true facts with respect to the cost of the land, regardless of the exact date upon which the formation of a partnership was consummated, or a joint adventure begun.</p>\n<p> There is no question that such an arrangement was made with respect to the National ranch, which was purchased from Judson after the parties hereto had begun their negotiations, about March 1, 1923. The parties were then negotiating for the sale to the respondent of a half interest in both the Otay and National ranches, a total of about 11,000 acres. In his letter of March 6th, the appellant referred to their \"mutual interests\" and expressed the hope that they would \"each make a 'killing' on our proposition\". At that time the respondent had not agreed to buy an interest in either the Otay ranch or the National ranch, and he may well have taken a portion of this letter as relating to the purchase of both ranches and to their mutual interests in the entire proposition involved in their previous conversations. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*298</span> evidence supports the finding and conclusion that his purchase of a half interest in the Otay ranch was to be, like that of the National ranch, on a 50-50 basis, each party to pay an equal share of the cost of the land. The appellant required the respondent to pay to him one-half of the amounts he had advanced to tenants upon the land. Many of the circumstances shown by the evidence indicate that the respondent was justified in understanding and believing that he was purchasing a one-half interest in the Otay ranch by paying one-half of the cost thereof to the appellant, and that such cost was to be shared equally by them. While there is considerable conflicting evidence the question was one of fact for the jury, and its finding thereon is not without support.</p>\n<p> [5] It is next contended that it appears as a matter of law that the action was barred by the statute of limitations and that the evidence conclusively shows that the respondent, as a reasonable man, was put upon inquiry, that means of knowledge were open to him, and that a reasonable inquiry would have developed the true facts. A large part of this argument is devoted to the proposition that information was available which would have disclosed that the appellant had actually purchased the Otay ranch in 1922. In addition to what we have already said on this subject it should be remembered that the respondent lived in Ohio, that the transaction was closed by mail, and that the respondent was in San Diego very little for some years thereafter. The important consideration is whether circumstances existed which put the respondent upon his guard with respect to the action of the appellant in charging him more than his proportion of what the land had cost, and whether means of knowledge were open to the respondent which, if pursued, would have disclosed the true facts in that regard. The appellant relies upon the fact that trouble developed between the parties in 1925 and 1926 over the management of the ranch and the payment of existing obligations, which led to an agreement separating their interests, and which left the parties with considerable ill-will toward each other. There was some evidence that the respondent, after that time, told certain parties that the appellant had defrauded him in connection with the settlement of their affairs. Not only is that evidence contradicted by the testimony of the respondent but knowledge of wrongdoing on the part of the appellant in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*299</span> that connection could hardly be said, as a matter of law, to have put the respondent upon notice and to have required him to make an investigation as to the acts of the appellant in originally entering into the transaction.</p>\n<p> Moreover, it does not appear that means of knowledge were then open to the respondent or that any reasonable inquiry on his part would have developed the true facts with respect to the real fraud, which is here in issue. It appears that after he had received an intimation of this fraud, in 1936, the respondent went to Judson, from whom the land had been purchased, to Judson's attorney and to the real estate agent who had represented Judson, all of whom refused to give him any information on that subject. It does not appear that an earlier inquiry would have been more successful, and it is not to be anticipated that the appellant would have been any more helpful had an inquiry been made of him. While there is a great deal of evidence upon this subject, the only thing that clearly appears therefrom is that it is sharply conflicting in the respect now under consideration. From the record before us it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that the action was barred or that sufficient excuse was not shown for a failure to make an earlier discovery of the true facts. Again the question was one of fact for the jury. It may be said here as was said in Victor Oil Co. v. Drum, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></span> [193 P. 243]:</p>\n<p> \"Without some information which carried a direct implication or suggestion of possible fraud, the plaintiff could not be put upon inquiry. The courts will not lightly seize upon some small circumstance to deny relief to a party plainly shown to have been actually defrauded against those who defrauded him on the ground, forsooth, that he did not discover the fact that he had been cheated as soon as he might have done. It is only where the party defrauded should plainly have discovered the fraud except for his own inexcusable inattention that he will be charged with a discovery in advance of actual knowledge on his part. The present case is not of that character.\"</p>\n<p> [6] The next points raised are that the court erred in excluding testimony as to the value of this land and in refusing to instruct the jury to the effect that the measure of the respondent's damages, if any, would be the difference between the money he paid for the property and the value of the property he received. It is argued that since the action <span class=\"star-pagination\">*300</span> was in fact based upon fraudulent representations the measure of damages is fixed by section 3343 of the Civil Code. That section has no application in this case where, in the manner pointed out in Philpott v. Superior Court, supra, the respondent waived the tort and sued for the return of his money. In such an action the actual value of the land is not material and has nothing to do with the amount which the plaintiff has paid and which he seeks to have returned. (King v. Wise, 43 Cal. 628; Fink v. Weisman, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></span> [18 PaCal.2d 961].)</p>\n<p> [7] It is next urged that the court erred in admitting evidence concerning the sale of an interest in the National ranch to the respondent. While it is conceded that this evidence disclosed that the appellant had secured a secret profit in that deal it is argued that it was an entirely separate transaction and that evidence of a prior or subsequent fraud is not admissible. Not only was this evidence admissible for the purpose of showing intent (Atkins Corporation v. Tourny, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1187467\"><a href=\"/opinion/1187467/the-atkins-corporation-v-tourny/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span> [57 PaCal.2d 480]; Evans v. Gibson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></span> [31 PaCal.2d 389]), but it had a direct relation to the entire transaction and was admissible to prove the existence of a confidential relationship between the parties at that time and before the option for the purchase of the Otay ranch was exercised by the respondent. [8] It is further urged that the court erred in excluding evidence of public knowledge of the fact that the Otay ranch was owned by the defendant. The only thing referred to in this connection is that the court excluded an article supposed to have appeared in a newspaper published in San Diego. This article was published while the respondent was in Ohio, it did not show that the appellant owned the land in question, and a great deal of other evidence was admitted by the court for the purpose of showing such public knowledge. No reversible error appears in this connection.</p>\n<p> [9] Some contention is made that the differences between the parties were completely adjusted by the contracts of settlement which finally resulted, in 1936, in the appellant taking back the Otay ranch. That settlement had nothing to do with the original transaction here in question, and the facts upon which this action is based were not then known to the respondent. In so far as shown by the evidence, that settlement purported to settle certain matters between the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*301</span> parties and made no pretense of settling all of their differences or affairs.</p>\n<p> The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p> Griffin, J., and Haines, J., pro tem., concurred.</p>\n</div>","extracted_by_ocr":false,"opinions_cited":["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1167171/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1187467/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2181653/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2608133/"]},{"resource_uri":"https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1111624/","absolute_url":"/opinion/1111624/hoover-v-sweitzer/","cluster":"https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/1111624/","author":null,"joined_by":[],"date_created":"2013-10-30T04:06:08.733764Z","date_modified":"2016-02-29T01:44:06.611892Z","type":"010combined","sha1":"bb35f803359edca5e01b8a935d5b453b9e841243","download_url":null,"local_path":null,"plain_text":"","html":"","html_lawbox":"<div>\n<center><b>34 Cal.App.2d 441 (1939)</b></center>\n<center><h1>EBER L.

The appeal is upon the insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> and upon errors of law, namely, the misconduct of the district attorney in the making of certain remarks during the presentation of the evidence and the argument, the refusal of the trial court to instruct the jury to disregard the alleged prejudicial statements, the refusal to give an instruction covering lesser offenses, and the order, after the verdict of the jury, directing the filing of an amended information containing a prior conviction.</p>\n<p> [1] The transcript of evidence contains a detailed recitation by the stepdaughter of the first act of sexual intercourse with the appellant and references to many subsequent repetitions of the act, plus an admission by appellant that \"he was not the first one\" who had had sexual intercourse with the child. The defense consisted of a denial of the act, a statement that the minor was a \"masturbator\", and statements that the mother of the girl had originally persuaded the child to communicate the story by mail to a grandmother in Texas, who reported the facts to the authorities. Subsequently the mother was adjudged insane and during the trial was confined in a state hospital. Certain medical testimony was introduced indicating that an act or acts of sexual intercourse had been performed upon the child.

The appeal is upon the insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> and upon errors of law, namely, the misconduct of the district attorney in the making of certain remarks during the presentation of the evidence and the argument, the refusal of the trial court to instruct the jury to disregard the alleged prejudicial statements, the refusal to give an instruction covering lesser offenses, and the order, after the verdict of the jury, directing the filing of an amended information containing a prior conviction.</p>\n<p> [1] The transcript of evidence contains a detailed recitation by the stepdaughter of the first act of sexual intercourse with the appellant and references to many subsequent repetitions of the act, plus an admission by appellant that \"he was not the first one\" who had had sexual intercourse with the child. The defense consisted of a denial of the act, a statement that the minor was a \"masturbator\", and statements that the mother of the girl had originally persuaded the child to communicate the story by mail to a grandmother in Texas, who reported the facts to the authorities. Subsequently the mother was adjudged insane and during the trial was confined in a state hospital.

Gay was killed May 20, 1937, in an accident in which he was struck by a motor vehicle driven by defendant Lye, who was operating the vehicle in the course of his employment by Cadwallader-Gibson Co., Inc., hereinafter referred to as the lumber company. The action was commenced by the heirs at law of decedent to recover damages suffered because of his death. Defendants appeal from a judgment in favor of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p> Decedent was at the time of his death and had been for a period of approximately twelve years in the employ of Pacific Portland Cement Company, hereinafter referred to as the cement company, and of its predecessor, Standard Gypsum Company. The cement company and the lumber company were lessees of adjoining parcels of real property from Craig Shipbuilding Company. The cement company's lease was dated April 11, 1925, and contained the provision that the lessors reserve the right, \"To maintain and use the switch track now crossing the southwesterly portion of said demised premises, the approximate location of which is shown <span class=\"star-pagination\">*568</span> on said annexed map in red and black, such use, if said Lessee so desires, to be a joint use, each interfering with the use of the other as little as reasonably practicable.\" The switch track and the pathway hereinafter referred to were on a small parcel of land, a trifle less than one acre immediately adjoining the premises on which was erected a plant operated by the cement company. In 1927 the lumber company executed a lease with the Craig company and commenced to use the parcel of land just referred to jointly with the cement company. In 1934 an oral agreement was made by and between the lumber company and the Craig company by which the lumber company agreed to pay taxes on the parcel of land and would have the control of it. This oral agreement was not communicated to the cement company.</p>\n<p> [1] There is no discussion in the briefs concerning the rule of law that the purchaser or lessee of land is bound to take notice of all easements and servitudes which are apparent on inspection of the property. We will therefore take up the contention of plaintiffs that the findings are supported by the evidence and that they in turn support the judgment. The trial court found that it was necessary for decedent to use and he was making use of and traversing a well-defined pathway which ran relatively parallel with and in close proximity to the property and buildings in the possession and under the control of his employer; that the pathway was located on property in the possession and control of the lumber company; that the pathway in question had been in constant and continuous use by the cement company and its predecessor and their employees for a long time preceding the accident; that defendant Lye negligently operated a vehicle, known as a lumber carrier, resulting in the death of decedent. The court further found: \"That said defendant, Valentine Lye, at the time of and for a long time prior to the date of said accident, had knowledge of and knew of the existence of and the location of said pathway, and knew and had knowledge of the use being made thereof by the employees of said Pacific Portland Cement Company, and by said deceased, Charles Calloway Gay, and at all times had knowledge of and knew that said employees of said Pacific Portland Cement Company were constantly and continuously making use of and were traversing said well-defined pathway, and at all times knew that the various employees of said Pacific Portland Cement Company, including <span class=\"star-pagination\">*569</span> said deceased, Charles Calloway Gay, might be making use of and might be traversing said well-defined pathway at any time, and that various of said employees, including said deceased, Charles Calloway Gay, might reasonably be expected to be where said deceased was at the time of said accident; that said defendant, Valentine Lye, negligently failed to see and discover the presence of said deceased, Charles Calloway Gay, at the place where said accident occurred, prior to the happening of said accident.\"</p>\n<p> It appears from the evidence that the pathway referred to in the findings ran immediately beside the spur track referred to in the lease; that it was in daily use by the employees of the cement company in passing from one doorway to another in the cement company's plant; that for many years and up to the time of the accident both the lumber company and the cement company had used the parcel of land in question without objection from either of them. Cars of the cement company were stopped on the right of way for unloading crude gypsum and for the purpose of making repairs. Employees of the cement company daily walked up and down the pathway, which was their only means of getting to their crusher house. Defendant Lye testified: \"I have observed, on many occasions, that there is a doorway going into this rock crushing house, and I have seen that people went in and out through that doorway by means of walking along this right-of-way\". In a conversation with the witness Bell, defendant Lye, after stating that it was customary for him to drive back and forth, stated that it was a privilege both companies enjoyed.</p>\n<p> A photograph of the lumber carrier appears in the record. It is a high vehicle which does not afford its operator such a clear vision as is ordinarily afforded by drivers of automobiles. On the day of the accident defendant Lye loaded the carrier with lumber, backed it away from the lumber yard and started forward down the spur track, at which time he was traveling at the rate of 10 or 12 miles per hour. Decedent had just previously emerged from the plant of the cement company with his loaded wheelbarrow and had turned down the pathway when the lumber carrier overtook him from the rear, striking the wheelbarrow and causing injuries which resulted in his death.</p>\n<p> The contention of defendants that the findings do not support the judgment cannot be sustained. The trial court expressly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*570</span> found that the driver of the lumber carrier knew that decedent \"might reasonably be expected to be where said deceased was at the time of the said accident\". This finding is supported by the evidence. In 2 A. L. I. Restatement of the Law of Torts, section 346, it is stated: \"A possessor of land is subject to liability to others who are privileged to enter it for a public or private purpose, irrespective of his consent, for bodily harm there caused to them by his failure, after he knows or from facts within his knowledge should know of their presence on the land, to conduct his activities thereon with reasonable care for their safety\". This statement was referred to with approval in Hamakawa v. Crescent Wharf etc. Co., 4 Cal.2d 499, where at page 503 [50 PaCal.2d 803], this observation is made: \"In the final analysis, as recognized by those same authorities, the test is whether the defendant engaged in the commission of the negligent act knew of or had reason to expect the presence of the person injured within the range of his negligent activities.\" In Lucas v. Walker, 22 Cal.App. 296, 300 [134 P. 374, 376], cited in the Hamakawa case, the court said: \"But if it be conceded that plaintiff was a mere licensee of defendant when he was hurt it is still true that he was upon the premises and doing the work in question with the knowledge and consent of defendant. This is admitted by the pleadings. A licensee under such circumstances is entitled to recover for any injury to himself, in the absence of contributory negligence upon his part, resulting from the active negligence of the licensor, and such licensor is responsible in damages for any overt act of negligence though the same be neither willful nor wanton.\" The trial court made no specific finding as to whether decedent was a licensee at the time of the accident, but it matters not whether he be called a licensee, invitee, or one exercising the right of his employer in accordance with the terms of the employer's lease. Defendant Lye had reason to expect that employees of the cement company would be using the pathway at the time he was operating the lumber carrier and he was charged with the duty of refraining from negligently injuring them. (Pomponio v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., 66 Conn. 528 [34 Atl. 491, 494, 50 Am.St.Rep. 124, 32 L.R.A. 530].)</p>\n<p> [2] There is no merit in the contention of defendants that decedent was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter <span class=\"star-pagination\">*571</span> of law. In this connection it should be noted, in addition to the facts above set forth, that a great noise called by defendant Lye a \"roar\" and a \"rumble\" was coming from the cement plant as decedent was slowly moving his wheel-barrow in front of the oncoming lumber carrier. Moreover, plaintiffs were entitled to the benefit of the presumption that decedent took ordinary care for his own safety. We are not unmindful of the rule that this presumption is dispelled when a fact wholly irreconcilable with it is proved by the uncontradicted testimony of the party relying on it or of such party's own witnesses, when such testimony was not the product of mistake or inadvertence.

Approximately two weeks after the entry of said judgment petitioner instituted the present proceeding in habeas corpus for their release.</p>\n<p> It appears from the record produced in support of the return to the writ that the father of the children died in 1935, and the mother in May, 1937. They were residents of Contra Costa County; and following the death of her husband Mrs. Jones received state and county aid. The father was survived by a sister, Mrs. Lewis Oliver, a resident of Los Angeles, and several brothers and sisters in England; and Mrs. Jones was survived by relatives residing in this state, among them being an uncle, Peter Benson. The petitioner, John Savage, and his wife are residents of San Francisco, and were close friends of many years' standing of the parents of the children. At the time Mrs. Jones died, Mrs. Oliver was visiting her relatives in England; and the Contra Costa County authorities consented that petitioner and his wife take the children to live with them at their home in San Francisco. Mrs. Jones left insurance money and a small savings account, amounting in all to $1400; and Peter Benson applied for and was granted letters of guardianship of the children. In November, 1937, Mrs. Oliver returned from England and applied to the court in Contra Costa County to be appointed guardian in the place of Benson, with the view of taking the children to England to live with their father's relatives. The following month, December, 1937, Benson was stricken with a fatal illness and died soon afterwards; thereupon petitioner filed an application to be appointed guardian in opposition to the pending petition of Mrs. Oliver. His petition was granted, and later at his request the guardianship proceeding was transferred to San Francisco. Approximately $1174 of the guardianship funds were expanded, $600 or thereabouts having been used to pay the funeral expenses of Mrs. Jones, $180 to reimburse petitioner and his wife for the money they had expended in behalf of the children during the year and a half or more they had cared for them, and the remainder for attorney's fees and court costs; so that only $226 remained in the hands of the guardian. Thereupon petitioner made an application to the department of social welfare agency in San Francisco for the $20 a month allowance for each child provided by law for the care of full orphans. He <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> was referred to Miss Leete (assistant probation officer) who, after making an investigation of the case, caused to be prepared a petition to the juvenile court, which petitioner verified, wherein he asked that the children be made wards of the court. Said verified petition was filed on January 24, 1939; and thereafter, as stated, two court hearings were had, which resulted in the rendition of the judgment petitioner now claims is void.</p>\n<p> The writ of habeas corpus was issued upon the strength of certain allegations in the petition to the effect that no evidence whatever was taken at any time \"in behalf of any person\"; that petitioner sought to introduce testimony at the final hearing of the matter but was not permitted to do so; that consequently the judgment is without evidentiary support. But the record produced at the hearing in support of the return to the writ clearly negatives such allegations and shows a substantial compliance with all necessary jurisdictional requirements. It appears therefrom that when petitioner made application to have the children adjudged wards of the court the probation officer, in conformity with the provisions of sections 638 and 639 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, caused a full and complete investigation to be made of the case, including an inquiry into the antecedents, character, family history and environment of said children, and made a written report thereof to the judge of the juvenile court. This written report was presented to the court in accordance with section 640 of said code at the first hearing of the matter, held on January 25, 1939, and was at all times open to the inspection of petitioner and his attorney. Present at said hearing were Miss Leete, the children, petitioner and his wife and their attorney, and Mrs. Oliver. In presenting the matter to the court Miss Leete supplemented the facts set forth in the report with a statement covering all of the circumstances of the case; whereupon, to the end that appropriate orders might be made concerning the custody and future welfare of the children, the court interrogated all interested parties, especially as to the family history, the chief question at issue being whether it would be to the best interests of the children to place them with their relatives in England as requested by Mrs. Oliver, or to allow them to remain with petitioner and his wife. Petitioner and his attorney, Mrs. Oliver and Miss Leete all took part in laying <span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> the facts before the court, and finally, in order to ascertain definitely whether the relatives in England would give the children a home with them, and if so whether they were financially able to care for them, further hearing of the matter was continued for six weeks. On March 29, 1939, the matter came on for the second and final hearing before the court, among those present besides the juvenile court officers and the children being petitioner and his attorney. At that time Miss Leete presented a supplemental written report to the court and amplified it with an oral statement; and the important facts developed at said hearing were these: that petitioner had informed the probation officer it would not be possible for him to take care of the children without state and county aid; that satisfactory assurance had been given to the juvenile court authorities by Richard Jones, one of the uncles living in London, that he would be pleased to give the children a permanent home with his family, and that with the assistance of other members of the Jones family (one of his brothers being a major in the British army) ample provision would be made for their support and education; furthermore, that Mrs. Oliver intended to return to England soon, and would take the children with her; and that whatever additional sum of money was necessary over the amount remaining in the guardianship funds to cover the transportation expenses would be supplied by the juvenile court out of the \"Maintenance of Minor\" funds. Thereupon, and after the court had expressed the conviction that the children should be reared by their kinsfolk, petitioner asked permission to withdraw his petition; but the judge replied that inasmuch as the relatives had come forward and offered the children a permanent home, he felt that petitioner's request to withdraw the petition should be denied. The court then granted the motion of the probation officer that the children be declared wards of the court and indicated that whenever definite arrangements were perfected to transport them to their relatives in England, an order would be made to that effect.</p>\n<p> [1] In thus disposing of the proceeding the juvenile court conformed to all procedural requirements of the juvenile court law; and admittedly the judgment itself is in legal form. The recitals therein show that the necessary jurisdictional steps were taken and it contains all the essential findings of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> fact and conclusions of law demanded by the statute. Such being the case, it is beyond the power of this court on habeas corpus to go behind the judgment to review either the evidence or any errors or irregularities which are alleged to have occurred before the juvenile court. (14 Cal.Jur. 148.) Adequate remedy is made therefor by way of appeal from the judgment. (Sec. 580, Welfare and Institutions Code.)</p>\n<p> [2] It is true the hearing was not conducted with all the strict formality of a criminal proceeding; but it was not necessary to do so because as frequently pointed out by the courts, proceedings of the juvenile court in dealing with cases of dependent children are not of a criminal nature. (In re Edwards, 99 Cal.App. 541 [278 P. 910, 290 P. 591], citing earlier cases.) Such court operates under special powers, in conformity with procedure prescribed therefor by the juvenile court law, which authorize the consideration by the juvenile court, in cases of this kind, of the written reports and recommendations of the probation officer, which under said law are open to inspection of the interested parties. (Secs. 638, 639 and 640, Welfare and Institutions Code.) In other words, from its very nature and because of necessary qualifications for doing the work for which it is intended, the juvenile court was not designed as a trial court in the ordinary sense; and its method of operation is very different from the one governing in the trial of criminal cases, mainly because technicalities and formalities are largely eliminated. (People v. Superior Court, 104 Cal.App. 276 [285 P. 871].)</p>\n<p> Petitioner cites In re Hill, 78 Cal.App. 23 [247 P. 591], but obviously there is no analogy between that case and the present one. In the first place, unlike the case before us, the proceeding therein was instituted against the parents to deprive them of the custody of their child, based on allegations to the effect that the mother was cruel to the child; secondly, the cause was brought before the appellate court by the parents on an appeal from the judgment, which permitted a review of the evidence on the merits; third, the record showed that the juvenile court made no findings of fact whatever, which are essential under the statute; fourth, the attorney representing the parents was excluded from the hearing by order of the court; and lastly it appears from the decision therein that the judgment depriving the parents of the custody <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> of their child was based on apparently nothing more than secret information imparted privately to the judge by undisclosed persons; and that neither the parents of the child nor their attorney was afforded any opportunity to ascertain the identity of those persons or what specific charges they had made; nor were they allowed to question any of those persons for any purpose. [3] Whereas here the record reveals no ground upon which it may be held that petitioner was deprived of any legal right granted by the juvenile law; and since it affirmatively appears that the court acquired jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the parties in conformity with the requirements of the statute, it was entirely within the discretion of the court to deny petitioner's request for permission to withdraw his petition.</p>\n<p> [4] The application for the writ also contains certain allegations to the effect that when petitioner first consulted Miss Leete he was unaware of the fact that she was an assistant probation officer; that she did not explain to him the nature or the purpose of the petition he signed and verified, and that he did not learn of the legal effect thereof until some three months later when he consulted his attorney. It is quite evident, however, that the allegations mentioned involve matters of fact which are not the proper subject of inquiry on habeas corpus. Quite to the contrary, it must be assumed that ample evidence was presented to justify the findings and the judgment.

They are full orphans, and were adjudged wards of said court by the judgment thereof pursuant to proceedings initiated by the filing of a verified petition by the said John Savage, their guardian, wherein he alleged that the children were destitute and without means of support. Two hearings were had before the juvenile court; petitioner and his attorney were personally present at both, and at the final hearing petitioner requested permission to withdraw the petition.

J.</p>\n<p> The defendant was charged with the crime of burglary. The information further charged two prior convictions, it being alleged that on or about December 21, 1922, he was, in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, convicted of the crime of burglary and sentenced to San Quentin and that on October 28, 1924, he was, in the Superior Court of San Diego County, convicted of the crime of burglary and sentenced to Folsom. He was arraigned on June 24, 1935, and pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity, but admitted the prior convictions as charged. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*329</span></p>\n<p> On July 16, 1935, a jury found him guilty of burglary in the second degree. After that verdict was returned it was stipulated that the same jury might try the issue of insanity and the court set the hearing on that plea for July 23, 1935, and fixed the time for pronouncing sentence for July 20, 1935. On that day, the court adjudged the defendant an habitual criminal and sentenced him to imprisonment in Folsom for the term prescribed by law. It was then ordered that he be held in the county jail until after the trial on the plea of insanity \"to be held on July 23rd, 1935\". On that day, the jury returned a verdict finding him sane on the date charged in the information and, thereafter, he was taken to prison.</p>\n<p> On May 4, 1939, in the Superior Court of Riverside County the defendant moved for an order vacating and setting aside the judgment upon the ground that the same \"was prematurely entered and void\". Without directly deciding the motion the court, after reciting most of the facts above stated, found that the commitment had erroneously issued and ordered the defendant returned to court on May 22, 1939, \"for the purpose of having judgment pronounced in accordance with law\". On that day, a motion for a new trial on all statutory grounds and on the ground that sentence had not been pronounced within the time prescribed by law was made and denied. A motion in arrest of judgment on the same grounds was made and denied and the court then entered an order adjudging and decreeing the defendant to be an habitual criminal, that he be punished by imprisonment in the state prison at Folsom for life, that he should not be eligible for parole until he had served at least 12 years, and that he be remanded to custody. Thereupon, the defendant appealed from the order denying his motion for a new trial, from the order denying the motion in arrest of judgment and from the judgment.</p>\n<p> The appellant does not here complain of the fact that he was resentenced insofar as this affects the error in pronouncing judgment before the issue of insanity was tried. The correction of such errors by bringing back the defendant and resentencing him has been frequently upheld. (See People v. Marshall, 209 Cal. 540 [289 P. 629]; In re Lee, 177 Cal. 690 [171 P. 958]; People v. Wilson, 15 Cal.App.2d 172 [59 PaCal.2d 187]; People v. Stratton, 133 Cal.App. 309 [24 PaCal.2d 174].) [1] The respondent, however, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*330</span> contends that there was no right of appeal here since the same points might have been presented upon an appeal from the original judgment. In effect, the motion to vacate the original judgment was granted. The judgment thereafter entered was a final judgment and the appellant had the right to appeal therefrom and from the order denying a new trial. (Penal Code, sec. 1237; see, also, People v. Frye, 137 Cal.App. 525 [31 PaCal.2d 204]; People v. Marshall, supra.) The order denying the motion in arrest of judgment was not appealable.</p>\n<p> [2] The appellant contends that that portion of the judgment which adjudged him to be an habitual criminal is void because the information failed to allege, in connection with the prior convictions charged, that he had served terms therefor in a prison or penitentiary. It should be noted that while he admitted the priors as charged, this was not an admission that terms had been served. He relies upon People v. Marshall, 99 Cal.App. 224 [278 P. 258], People v. McKinley, 2 Cal.2d 133 [39 PaCal.2d 411], People v. Dawson, 210 Cal. 366 [292 P. 267], and People v. Arnest, 133 Cal.App. 114 [23 PaCal.2d 812]. The first two of these cases have no bearing on the present problem. In People v. Marshall, supra, no trial was had on the insanity issue and it was held that the court had no jurisdiction to pronounce sentence without hearing evidence on the insanity plea. In People v. McKinley, supra, the court held that it was not necessary for the judgment to contain a statement that the defendant had served a prior term for a prior conviction where that fact was alleged, proved and found by the jury. The other two cases contain some language which tends to support the appellant's contention. In People v. Dawson, supra, after noting that one of the requirements of section 667 of the Penal Code is that the defendant must have served a term in some penal institution in connection with a prior conviction, it is stated that \"the necessary facts must be both pleaded and proved\". Immediately thereafter, however, the court points out that the case of People v. Sampson, 99 Cal.App. 306 [278 P. 492], recognizes the fact that, in establishing a foundation for a valid judgment imposing a more severe sentence on account of a previous conviction of a felony, \"it is essential that in some manner it appear that he has 'served a term therefor' in some penal institution\". The opinion in People v. Arnest, supra, also contains language <span class=\"star-pagination\">*331</span> to the effect that if the information fails to charge that a term in prison was served it fails to charge facts essential to support a judgment based upon a prior conviction. In both of these cases, however, the defendant had pleaded guilty and, in effect, it was held that the fact that he had served a term upon a prior conviction was neither alleged nor proved. It should also be noted that neither of those cases mentioned or discussed section 969 of the Penal Code, which clearly provides that in charging a previous conviction of a felony in an indictment or information it is sufficient to state that the defendant had previously, in a named court, been convicted of a felony.</p>\n<p> In the case of In re Boatwright, 216 Cal. 677 [15 PaCal.2d 755], the defendant sought his release on habeas corpus after having been convicted of petit theft with prior convictions. The information alleged, as to each of the prior convictions, that the judgment had been pronounced and had never been reversed or set aside, but failed to charge that a term had been served in any penal institution. The defendant admitted the prior convictions \"as charged in the information\" and pleaded not guilty. No evidence concerning the prior convictions was introduced at the trial but when the defendant's statement was taken, before judgment was pronounced, he admitted that he had served time in penal institutions in connection with three of the former convictions. No appeal was taken from the judgment but after the defendant had served the requisite time, as for a first offense, the habeas corpus proceeding was brought. The court held that the information was sufficient in the light of the provisions of section 969 of the Penal Code, but held that proof of service of terms in penal institutions under the prior convictions was essential in order to give the court jurisdiction to adjudge the defendant an habitual criminal. The court said that while the better practice was to allege the service of terms under the prior convictions, the defendant could not be said to have suffered any prejudice by the failure to allege this in the information, inasmuch as he admitted before the judgment was pronounced that he had served such terms. In referring to People v. Dawson, supra, and People v. Sampson, supra, the court said: \"The most that can be said for those cases is that, while the information did not charge service of time under said convictions, it was not shown, as a matter of fact, that the defendant in those cases had actually <span class=\"star-pagination\">*332</span> served a term under said prior convictions.\" The defendant was then ordered discharged for another reason.</p>\n<p> In People v. Birdsell, 6 Cal.App.2d 749 [45 PaCal.2d 378], the information failed to allege that the defendant had served terms in connection with prior convictions which were charged but upon arraignment he admitted that he had served a separate term in prison on each of the prior convictions. The court held that this was sufficient. In People v. Harvey, 137 Cal.App. 22 [29 PaCal.2d 787], the serving of time was not alleged in the information but the record showed that the defendant had admitted that fact, and this also was held sufficient. Similar holdings are to be found in People v. Birdsell, 21 Cal.App.2d 682 [70 PaCal.2d 231], People v. Frye, supra, and in In re Boatwright, 119 Cal.App. 420 [6 PaCal.2d 972].</p>\n<p> In the instant case the information complied with the requirements of section 969 of the Penal Code and we therefore hold that the part of the judgment which rests upon the charge of prior convictions was not void merely because the service of terms in connection with those convictions was not alleged in the information.</p>\n<p> [3] It was necessary, however, that the fact that such terms had been served should be established either by evidence or by the admission of the appellant before judgment was pronounced. It is next contended by the appellant that the service of terms in connection with both of the particular prior convictions with which he was charged was not here established either by his admission or by the evidence. This contention must be sustained.</p>\n<p> During the trial on the insanity issue a statement made by the appellant to the district attorney and taken down by a reporter was, by stipulation, received and read into evidence. In this statement the appellant admitted that he had served 18 months in San Quentin, although he stated that he was there in 1921 upon a conviction in San Diego on a charge of burglary. He further admitted that he went to Folsom in 1924 upon conviction in San Diego of a charge of first degree burglary and that he there served \"seven years or more\". He further stated that he served a term in the state prison of Arizona \"for counterfeiting and robbing box cars\", that he served a term for burglary in the state prison in Columbus, Ohio, and that he served a term of three years and four months in the state prison in Colorado, from 1914 to 1917. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*333</span> He further stated that he was \"wanted in Arizona for several different charges\". While he admitted having served terms upon five prior convictions, one of which corresponded to one of those alleged in the information, none of the others corresponded to the other prior with which he was charged. As a result, the evidence fails to establish the service of a term in connection with each of the prior convictions charged and fails to sustain that part of the judgment adjudging the appellant to be an habitual criminal.</p>\n<p> [4] Charges of prior convictions affect the circumstances surrounding the commission of a new offense and are to be considered for their effect upon the new offense which is charged. The proving of such prior convictions is a statutory proceeding and since the amendment of section 969a of the Penal Code, in 1931, there is no statutory authorization for passing upon the question as to whether such convictions have been suffered other than in connection with the new offense charged and by the same jury. (People v. Ysabel, 28 Cal.App.2d 259 [82 PaCal.2d 476].) [5] It is not practicable, therefore, by a reversal of that part of this judgment affecting the prior convictions, to remand the cause for further trial on that issue. Such a course was followed in People v. Willison, 116 Cal.App. 157 [2 PaCal.2d 543]. But, in that case, the new offense charged was committed and the judgment was pronounced prior to the amendment of section 969a in 1931.</p>\n<p> In a number of cases where there was a failure to establish the fact that terms had been served in connection with prior convictions charged, the judgment has been modified by eliminating that portion based upon the prior convictions while affirming the remainder, or the judgment has been reversed with instructions to the trial court to resentence the defendant on a similar basis. (People v. Dawson, supra; People v. Arnest, supra; People v. Lohr, 28 Cal.App.2d 397 [82 PaCal.2d 615]; People v. Valdez, 3 Cal.App.2d 700 [40 PaCal.2d 592]; People v. Hayes, 3 Cal.App.2d 59 [39 PaCal.2d 213]; People v. Pace, 2 Cal.App.2d 464 [38 PaCal.2d 202]; People v. d'A Philippo, 220 Cal. 620 [32 PaCal.2d 962]; People v. Shaw, 137 Cal.App. 533 [30 PaCal.2d 1031].) In all or nearly all of these cases it appears either that the defendant could not have been convicted as an habitual criminal, or that it did not appear that the defendant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*334</span> had actually served terms on the requisite number of prior convictions.</p>\n<p> We are here confronted with a somewhat different situation. While there is a variance between the charges of prior convictions contained in the information and the established facts with reference to terms actually served by the appellant in connection with prior convictions of felony, it appears from the admission of the appellant that two such terms were actually served in this state and at least three such terms were served in other states. While ample facts were established to sustain an adjudication that the appellant was an habitual criminal that part of the judgment cannot stand because of a technical error. Under such circumstances, the appellant should not be freed from the habitual criminal charge and resentenced as an ordinary offender or even as one who has suffered one prior conviction. He has appealed from the entire judgment and we are at liberty to treat the case as one where error not only appears in connection with one of the issues but where that issue is directly related to and intimately connected with the other issue. It would seem that upon a retrial evidence would be available to show that the appellant had served terms upon two prior convictions in this state. It might also be possible to procure evidence of the serving of terms upon one or more of the prior convictions in other states which were here admitted by the appellant. In such event, the information could still be amended to charge such further priors since the charge upon the new offense would still be pending.</p>\n<p> The appeal from the order denying the motion in arrest of judgment is dismissed. The appeals from the judgment and from the order denying the motion for a new trial are reversed and the cause in its entirety is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p> Griffin, J., and Haines, J., pro tem., concurred.</p>\n</div>","html_columbia":null,"html_with_citations":"<div>\n<center><b><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Mackall for Appellant.</p>\n<p> Earl Warren, Attorney-General, and Bayard Rhone, Deputy Attorney-General, for Respondent.</p>\n<p> Barnard, P. J.</p>\n<p> The defendant was charged with the crime of burglary. The information further charged two prior convictions, it being alleged that on or about December 21, 1922, he was, in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, convicted of the crime of burglary and sentenced to San Quentin and that on October 28, 1924, he was, in the Superior Court of San Diego County, convicted of the crime of burglary and sentenced to Folsom. He was arraigned on June 24, 1935, and pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity, but admitted the prior convictions as charged. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*329</span></p>\n<p> On July 16, 1935, a jury found him guilty of burglary in the second degree. After that verdict was returned it was stipulated that the same jury might try the issue of insanity and the court set the hearing on that plea for July 23, 1935, and fixed the time for pronouncing sentence for July 20, 1935. On that day, the court adjudged the defendant an habitual criminal and sentenced him to imprisonment in Folsom for the term prescribed by law. It was then ordered that he be held in the county jail until after the trial on the plea of insanity \"to be held on July 23rd, 1935\". On that day, the jury returned a verdict finding him sane on the date charged in the information and, thereafter, he was taken to prison.</p>\n<p> On May 4, 1939, in the Superior Court of Riverside County the defendant moved for an order vacating and setting aside the judgment upon the ground that the same \"was prematurely entered and void\". Without directly deciding the motion the court, after reciting most of the facts above stated, found that the commitment had erroneously issued and ordered the defendant returned to court on May 22, 1939, \"for the purpose of having judgment pronounced in accordance with law\". On that day, a motion for a new trial on all statutory grounds and on the ground that sentence had not been pronounced within the time prescribed by law was made and denied. A motion in arrest of judgment on the same grounds was made and denied and the court then entered an order adjudging and decreeing the defendant to be an habitual criminal, that he be punished by imprisonment in the state prison at Folsom for life, that he should not be eligible for parole until he had served at least 12 years, and that he be remanded to custody. Thereupon, the defendant appealed from the order denying his motion for a new trial, from the order denying the motion in arrest of judgment and from the judgment.</p>\n<p> The appellant does not here complain of the fact that he was resentenced insofar as this affects the error in pronouncing judgment before the issue of insanity was tried. The correction of such errors by bringing back the defendant and resentencing him has been frequently upheld. (See People v. Marshall, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></span> [289 P. 629]; In re Lee, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></span> [171 P. 958]; People v.

App.</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></span> [24 PaCal.2d 174].) [1] The respondent, however, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*330</span> contends that there was no right of appeal here since the same points might have been presented upon an appeal from the original judgment. In effect, the motion to vacate the original judgment was granted. The judgment thereafter entered was a final judgment and the appellant had the right to appeal therefrom and from the order denying a new trial. (Penal Code, sec. 1237; see, also, People v. Frye, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></span> [31 PaCal.2d 204]; People v. Marshall, supra.) The order denying the motion in arrest of judgment was not appealable.</p>\n<p> [2] The appellant contends that that portion of the judgment which adjudged him to be an habitual criminal is void because the information failed to allege, in connection with the prior convictions charged, that he had served terms therefor in a prison or penitentiary. It should be noted that while he admitted the priors as charged, this was not an admission that terms had been served. He relies upon People v. Marshall, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></span> [278 P. 258], People v. McKinley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1114285\"><a href=\"/opinion/1114285/people-v-mckinley/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span> [39 PaCal.2d 411], People v. Dawson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></span> [292 P. 267], and People v. Arnest, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span></span> [23 PaCal.2d 812]. The first two of these cases have no bearing on the present problem. In People v. Marshall, supra, no trial was had on the insanity issue and it was held that the court had no jurisdiction to pronounce sentence without hearing evidence on the insanity plea. In People v. McKinley, supra, the court held that it was not necessary for the judgment to contain a statement that the defendant had served a prior term for a prior conviction where that fact was alleged, proved and found by the jury. The other two cases contain some language which tends to support the appellant's contention. In People v. Dawson, supra, after noting that one of the requirements of section 667 of the Penal Code is that the defendant must have served a term in some penal institution in connection with a prior conviction, it is stated that \"the necessary facts must be both pleaded and proved\". Immediately thereafter, however, the court points out that the case of People v. Sampson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></span> [278 P. 492], recognizes the fact that, in establishing a foundation for a valid judgment imposing a more severe sentence on account of a previous conviction of a felony, \"it is essential that in some manner it appear that he has 'served a term therefor' in some penal institution\". The opinion in People v. Arnest, supra, also contains language <span class=\"star-pagination\">*331</span> to the effect that if the information fails to charge that a term in prison was served it fails to charge facts essential to support a judgment based upon a prior conviction. In both of these cases, however, the defendant had pleaded guilty and, in effect, it was held that the fact that he had served a term upon a prior conviction was neither alleged nor proved. It should also be noted that neither of those cases mentioned or discussed section 969 of the Penal Code, which clearly provides that in charging a previous conviction of a felony in an indictment or information it is sufficient to state that the defendant had previously, in a named court, been convicted of a felony.</p>\n<p> In the case of In re Boatwright, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></span> [15 PaCal.2d 755], the defendant sought his release on habeas corpus after having been convicted of petit theft with prior convictions. The information alleged, as to each of the prior convictions, that the judgment had been pronounced and had never been reversed or set aside, but failed to charge that a term had been served in any penal institution. The defendant admitted the prior convictions \"as charged in the information\" and pleaded not guilty. No evidence concerning the prior convictions was introduced at the trial but when the defendant's statement was taken, before judgment was pronounced, he admitted that he had served time in penal institutions in connection with three of the former convictions. No appeal was taken from the judgment but after the defendant had served the requisite time, as for a first offense, the habeas corpus proceeding was brought. The court held that the information was sufficient in the light of the provisions of section 969 of the Penal Code, but held that proof of service of terms in penal institutions under the prior convictions was essential in order to give the court jurisdiction to adjudge the defendant an habitual criminal. The court said that while the better practice was to allege the service of terms under the prior convictions, the defendant could not be said to have suffered any prejudice by the failure to allege this in the information, inasmuch as he admitted before the judgment was pronounced that he had served such terms. In referring to People v. Dawson, supra, and People v. Sampson, supra, the court said: \"The most that can be said for those cases is that, while the information did not charge service of time under said convictions, it was not shown, as a matter of fact, that the defendant in those cases had actually <span class=\"star-pagination\">*332</span> served a term under said prior convictions.\" The defendant was then ordered discharged for another reason.</p>\n<p> In People v. Birdsell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1287727\"><a href=\"/opinion/1287727/people-v-birdsell/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span> [45 PaCal.2d 378], the information failed to allege that the defendant had served terms in connection with prior convictions which were charged but upon arraignment he admitted that he had served a separate term in prison on each of the prior convictions. The court held that this was sufficient. In People v. Harvey, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></span> [29 PaCal.2d 787], the serving of time was not alleged in the information but the record showed that the defendant had admitted that fact, and this also was held sufficient.

He further admitted that he went to Folsom in 1924 upon conviction in San Diego of a charge of first degree burglary and that he there served \"seven years or more\". He further stated that he served a term in the state prison of Arizona \"for counterfeiting and robbing box cars\", that he served a term for burglary in the state prison in Columbus, Ohio, and that he served a term of three years and four months in the state prison in Colorado, from 1914 to 1917. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*333</span> He further stated that he was \"wanted in Arizona for several different charges\".

App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span> [82 PaCal.2d 476].) [5] It is not practicable, therefore, by a reversal of that part of this judgment affecting the prior convictions, to remand the cause for further trial on that issue. Such a course was followed in People v. Willison, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></span> [2 PaCal.2d 543]. But, in that case, the new offense charged was committed and the judgment was pronounced prior to the amendment of section 969a in 1931.</p>\n<p> In a number of cases where there was a failure to establish the fact that terms had been served in connection with prior convictions charged, the judgment has been modified by eliminating that portion based upon the prior convictions while affirming the remainder, or the judgment has been reversed with instructions to the trial court to resentence the defendant on a similar basis.

A bona fide strike may exist against such employer generally, or may exist only at one or more of the separate places of business of such employer. In the latter case this subsection (c) shall be applied and interpreted, with respect to the determination of 'bona fide employees' and 'majority', as if the place or places of business at which said bona fide strike exists were the only place or places of business of such employer.\"</p>\n<p> \"(d) The term 'bona fide employee' of any employer shall mean a real person (1) who is employed by such employer and has been continuously employed by such employer for a period of not less than thirty (30) days, or (2) who was employed by such employer and had been continuously employed by such employer for a period of not less than thirty (30) days at the time a majority of such bona fide employees of such employer voted for or commenced a bona fide strike against such employer; but shall not include any employee or former employee of an employer if such employee or former employee shall have entered such employment for the purpose of picketing or of creating an industrial dispute or strike.\"</p>\n<p> Other material parts of the ordinance were set forth in People v. Tilkin, supra, 34 Cal.App.2d Supp. 743 [90 PaCal.2d 148], and will not be repeated here in full. The prohibitions here in question appear in sections 3 and 4, which, as we held in People v. Tilkin, are to be construed together and create a considerable number of separate offenses, the various provisions of section 4 being regarded as parts of the definitions of these offenses, and not mere exceptions to section 3. The provision of section 3 which is a part of the charge in each of these cases refers to picketing on a public street \"in a manner calculated ... to induce or influence any person to refrain from entering, occupying or leaving any place of business, or to refrain from performing services or labor, or to refrain from seeking or obtaining employment, or to refrain from purchasing, selling, using, delivering, transporting or receiving any goods, wares, merchandise, services, entertainment, accomodations or articles\". Section 4, as construed in People v. Tilkin, supra, adds to this description, in completion of the definition of one [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 762] of the offenses created by these sections--that charged here in People v. Gidaly, Cr. A. No. 1602--provision that picketing shall not be done in the manner described in section 3 at a place of business where there is no \"bona fide strike\", and adds, in completing the definition of another offense--that charged in count II of the complaint in People v. Aragon, Cr. A. No. 1607--provision that picketing shall not be so done by any person who is not a \"bona fide employee\" at the place picketed. Count I of the last-mentioned complaint charged an offense of which the defendants were found not guilty.</p>\n<p> The facts in each case are undisputed and were presented to the trial court by a written stipulation. In People v. Gidaly, it appears that the place of business picketed had twenty \"bona fide\" employees, that seventeen of them remained at work and three struck for higher wages. These facts prevented the strike from being \"bona fide\" within the definition above quoted. Appellant Gidaly, who picketed this place of business, was one of the three strikers. In People v. Aragon there was a strike in which thirty of the thirty-two employees took part, and there is no showing that it was for any reason not \"bona fide\", but two of the appellants who picketed the place of business where the strike occurred were not and never had been employees there, being union organizers, and the third had been employed there continuously for only 24 days at the time of the strike. These three appellants were therefore not \"bona fide\" employees within the terms of the ordinance.</p>\n<p> There is no contention in either case that the stipulated facts do not support the charge made, but both of the ordinance provisions on which the charges are based are attacked on constitutional grounds, one of which is that the classifications made by the ordinance in its definitions of \"bona fide strike\" and \"bona fide employee\", above quoted, are unreasonable and arbitrary and hence in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, particularly its provision forbidding a denial of the equal protection of the laws, and also of the provisions of the California Constitution. This contention must be sustained.</p>\n<p> [1] In passing on the matter, we begin with two propositions. In the first place, whatever desire the framers of this ordinance may have had to discourage strikes, they gave no expression to any such desire by incorporating in [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 763] the ordinance any prohibition of strikes. Neither this ordinance nor any other of which we are advised, nor any state law, forbids strikes. The right to strike is fully recognized in California. (Parkinson v. Building Trades Council, (1908) 154 Cal. 581, 599 [98 P. 1027, 16 Ann. Cas. 1165, 21 L.R.A. (N. S.) 550]; Lisse v. Local Union No. 31, (1935) 2 Cal.2d 312, 318 [41 PaCal.2d 314].) In the second place, the ordinance before us, as we held in People v. Tilkin, supra, 34 Cal.App.2d Supp. 743 [90 PaCal.2d 148, 153], has as its purpose the regulation, not the suppression of picketing, which it recognizes as a proper instrumentality for use in labor disputes. In pursuance of its purpose, and to set up criteria for determining who may picket and under what circumstances it may be done, classifications have been made by the ordinance, and the only question we have to pass upon is that of their validity.</p>\n<p> [2] The rules governing the validity of legislative classification under the Fourteenth Amendment are well settled. That amendment applies to city ordinances. (Home Tel. etc. Co. v. Los Angeles, (1913) 227 U.S. 278, 294 [33 S.Ct. 312, 57 L.Ed. 510, 518].) \"In order, however, that a statute shall be valid which contains a classification of persons or things for the purpose of legislation, such classification must be a reasonable one, and must be based on real distinctions in the subject matter which bear some relation to the object sought to be accomplished by the statute.\" (12 Cor. Jur. 1148, 1149.) \"The equal protection guaranteed by the Constitution forbids the legislature to select a person, natural or artificial, and impose upon him or it burdens and liabilities which are not cast upon others similarly situated. ... Neither can it make a classification of individuals or corporations which is purely arbitrary, and impose upon such class special burdens and liabilities. Even where the selection is not obviously unreasonable and arbitrary, if the discrimination is based upon matters which have no relation to the object sought to be accomplished, the same conclusion of unconstitutionality is affirmed.\" (Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. R. Co. v. Matthews, (1899) 174 U.S. 96, 104, 105 [19 S.Ct. 609, 43 L.Ed. 909].) \"While the difference need not be great, the classification must not be arbitrary or capricious, but must bear some just and reasonable relation to the object of the legislation.\" (Bayside Fish etc. Co. v. [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 764] Gentry, (1936) 297 U.S. 422, 429 [56 S.Ct. 513, 80 L.Ed. 772, 777].)</p>\n<p> The same principles have been established by the California decisions in applying to city ordinances and other legislation the provisions of section 21 of article I of the state Constitution that \"No special privileges or immunities shall ever be granted which may not be altered, revoked, or repealed by the legislature; nor shall any citizen, or class of citizens, be granted privileges or immunities which, upon the same terms, shall not be granted to all citizens.\" The Supreme Court said of this provision in In re Blois, (1918) 179 Cal. 291, 295 [176 P. 449], \"This latter section of the Constitution has been given direct application to statutes and ordinances which have been enacted and sought to be enforced either by the state or by political subdivisions thereof, and in which attempts have been made to discriminate in favor of or against particular persons or classes of persons as to whom no reasonable basis of discrimination can be seen to exist; and in all such cases the courts of this state have uniformly held such attempted legislation to be void.\" In In re Sumida, (1918) 177 Cal. 388, 391 [170 P. 823], the court, dealing with a city ordinance, quoted the following language from Ex parte Miller, (1912) 162 Cal. 687, 698 [124 P. 427]: \"'A law is general and uniform in its operation when it applies equally to all persons, embraced within the class to which it is addressed, provided such class is made upon some natural, intrinsic or constitutional distinction between the persons composing it and others not embraced in it. ... The difference on which the classification is based must be such as, in some reasonable degree, will account for or justify the peculiar legislation.'\" In Martin v. Superior Court, (1924) 194 Cal. 93, 100 [227 P. 762], the court said: \"The classification, however, must not be arbitrarily made for the mere purpose of classification, but must be based upon some distinction, natural, intrinsic, or constitutional, which suggests a reason for and justifies the particular legislation. That is to say, not only must the class itself be germane to the purpose of the law but the individual components of the class must be characterized by some substantial qualities or attribute which suggest the need for and the propriety of the legislation.\" See, also, Gaetano Bocci &amp; Sons Co. v. Lawndale, (1930) 208 Cal. 720 [284 P. 654]; In re Gatsios, (1928) 95 Cal.App. 762, [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 765] 766 [273 P. 826]; In re Boehme, (1936) 12 Cal.App.2d 424, 428 [55 PaCal.2d 559], where the above-mentioned California cases are cited and the rules stated in them approved, and Bueneman v. Santa Barbara, (1937) 8 Cal.2d 405 [65 PaCal.2d 884, 109 A.L.R. 895], where the same rule was applied, the court saying, at page 413, \"For mere difference in classification does not meet constitutional requirements. Classification 'must always rest upon some difference which bears a reasonable and just relation to the act in respect to which the classification is proposed, and can never be made arbitrarily and without any such basis.' (Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Ellis, 165 U.S. 150, 155 [17 S.Ct. 255, 41 L.Ed. 666].)\"</p>\n<p> [3] Turning now to the ordinance in question, we find that, as applied to the facts of the cases before us, it makes several discriminations, and we are unable to see that any of them affords a proper basis for legislative classification in the matters now in hand. As already stated, the part of the ordinance involved in People v. Gidaly, Cr. A. No. 1602, is that prohibiting picketing of a place of business where less than a majority are on strike, and People v. Aragon, Cr. A. No. 1607, involves that part of it prohibiting picketing by persons who are not or have not been continuously for at least thirty days employees at the place of business picketed. To sum up the effect of these provisions, if a majority of the \"bona fide\" employees at a place of business or at all the employer's places of business, go on strike, such place may be picketed, but if less than that number strike none of them may picket; and no matter how many strike, persons not employees may not join them in picketing and employees who have been such less than thirty days continuously may not picket. How do these discriminations tend to promote the objects of the ordinance? Those objects, as we gather them from a consideration of its various prohibitions, are, first, to prevent obstruction of streets and other public places, and other interference with their use for passage; second, to prevent, in labor disputes, acts of intimidation and violence directed at persons engaged in those disputes or at other members of the public; and, third, to assure to the public and those affected by such disputes freedom from unlawful disturbance and annoyance arising from picketing.</p>\n<p> Considering the first of these objects, it is manifest that it can make no difference whether a picket is or has been [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 766] for thirty days an employee of the place picketed, and that interference with passage over the streets is not less likely when a majority of the employees are on strike. Moreover, that object seems well accomplished by section 10, which prohibits a variety of acts which would hinder or prevent free passage along streets and other public places. As to the second and third objects, we note that sections 7, 8, and 9 of the ordinance prohibit any person, be he picket or not, from engaging in acts of intimidation or coercion in connection with any place of business, section 2 thereof specially forbids pickets to do so, and sections 7, 8, and 9 prohibit also a variety of acts which might amount to mere annoyance or disturbance. With the activities of pickets thus limited, what difference can it make to the accomplishment of the objects of this ordinance whether or not they are employees at all or have been such for any particular length of time, or how many of the employees at the place picketed are on strike? We can see no such difference.</p>\n<p> Even were there no such other limitations on pickets, the classifications now under consideration would have no just or reasonable relation to the objects of the legislation, to use the phraseology of Bayside Fish etc. Co. v. Gentry, supra, 297 U.S. 422, 429, [56 S.Ct. 513, 80 L.Ed. 772, 777]. There is nothing in any experience to which our attention has been called and we see nothing in reason to suggest that pickets at a place where a minority of the employees are on strike will be any more given to violence, obstruction of streets, intimidation, annoyance and disturbance than those where a majority strike. Neither does it appear that the length of time a picket has been employed at the place he pickets bears any rational relation to the probability of his acting in a manner contravening the objects of this ordinance. We find no rational ground to suppose that a picket who is not employed at the place picketed, who may be a friend or relative of an employee, a person hired for the purpose, or an official of some union interested in the strike, will be any more active or urgent about the business of picketing or any more likely to engage in obnoxious conduct, than an employee. The latter has a personal interest in winning the strike, which furnishes him as strong an incentive to let the end justify the means, as any other picket is likely to have. The provision of the ordinance discriminating between employees and others and denying the latter [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 767] the right to picket, comes directly within this declaration made by the United States Supreme Court, arguendo, in Truax v. Corrigan, (1921) 257 U.S. 312, 335 [42 S.Ct. 124, 66 L.Ed. 254, 264, 27 A.L.R. 375, 387]: \"Suppose the legislature of the state were to provide that such acts as were here committed by defendants, to wit, the picketing or patrolling of the sidewalk and street in front of the store or business house of any person, and the use of handbills of an abusive and libelous character against the owner and present and future customers, with intent to injure the business of the owner, should be a public nuisance and be punishable by fine and imprisonment, and were to except ex-employees from its penal provisions. Is it not clear that any defendant could escape punishment under it on the ground that the statute violated the equality clause of the 14th Amendment? That is the necessary effect of Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U.S. 540 [46 L.Ed. 679, 22 S.Ct. 431].\"</p>\n<p> Again we call attention to the fact that in the situations selected by this ordinance for its permissive effect the picketing of a place of business may be done in such manner as is likely (and ordinarily its object would be) to induce persons not to enter or leave the place, not to work or seek employment there, and not to buy, sell, deliver or receive goods there, subject to other provisions of the ordinance against violence, coercion, intimidation and annoyance and some other limitations not now requiring consideration. No question arises as to the prohibition of such picketing altogether, for there is no such prohibition, but only as to the reasonableness of the standards bY which the ordinance has selected the persons by whom and the circumstances under which it may be done. By the established rules of constitutional law, such standards may not be arbitrary, but must have some reasonable relation to the object and purpose of the ordinance. Finding no such relation, we hold the prohibitions here in question invalid. The ordinance makes other discriminations, not here discussed, in its definitions of \"bona fide strike\" and \"bona fide employee\". The facts of these cases do not raise any question of the validity of those other discriminations, for it does not appear that any of the appellants is in any of the classes against whom such discriminations run. We have for that reason refrained from expressing an opinion regarding any of the other [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 768] discriminations. For similar reasons we do not decide upon the validity of various other provisions of the ordinance not involved in the charges made against the defendants.</p>\n<p> The judgments are reversed and the causes are remanded to the municipal court, with directions to dismiss the complaint in People v. Gidaly, Cr. A. No. 1602, and to dismiss count 2 of the complaint in People v. Aragon, Cr. A. No. 1607. The appeal from the order denying motion to quash and dismiss the complaint, in Cr. A. No. 1607, is dismissed.</p>\n<p> Bishop, J., concurred.</p>\n<p> Schauer, J.,</p>\n<p> Concurring.</p>\n<p> I concur. I am in accord with the conclusion reached by my associates, and with the propositions of law which support it, but think, however, that as an even more fundamental and essential constitutional right (than that which is made the basis of the foregoing opinion) has been discussed by counsel in presenting this case and is pertinent to this decision, that it should not go unmentioned in our opinion. I refer to the right of free speech together also with the independent but constitutionally cognate and equal rights of freedom of press and peaceable assembly. (U.S. Const., Amendments I and XIV.) Amendment I of the United States Constitution, which declares those liberties, is, in effect, made operative on the several states by Amendment XIV (Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, (1939) 307 U.S. 496 [59 S.Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423]; see, also, Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stats. at L. 13) and such rights are redeclared in the California Constitution (sec. 9, art. I).</p>\n<p> One cannot read the provisions of the ordinance here involved without knowing that it affects those constitutional rights in some measure. As was stated in the \"Affirmative Argument on Proposition No. 1 to Regulate Picketing\", which was a paper officially mailed to the voters preceding the September 16, 1938, election, at which the ordinance was adopted, \"The primary purpose of picketing is to advertise a dispute between employer and employees.\" As the \"display of a flag or banner 'as a sign, symbol or emblem of opposition to organized government'\" constitutes an exercise of the right of freedom of speech (Stromberg v. California, (1931) 238 U.S. 359, 365 [51 S.Ct. 532, 75 L.Ed. 1117, [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 769] 1121, 73 A.L.R. 1484]), so does picketing, to advertise a dispute between employees and employer, like other methods of expression or means of publication, likewise constitute an exercise of that right. Since it may differ, in its forms of manifestation, from the ordinary spoken or printed word, it may well be subject to reasonable regulations which might not be appropriate to the latter, but it is important that we frankly recognize it as a form of exercise of the fundamental liberty of speaking, writing and publishing one's views so that we shall not misapprehend the standards by which the validity of any regulations affecting it are to be tested. Pertinently, I find that the regulations involved in these cases cannot be sustained when so tested.</p>\n<p> The term \"to picket\" is defined, in the ordinance, to include walking or riding back and forth, or standing, sitting or remaining, in front or in the vicinity of, any place of business or residence or its approaches. A \"bona fide employee\" is one who, among other things, has been continuously employed by the employer, for not less than 30 days. On conditions enumerated a \"bona fide employee while carrying on lawful picketing\", which, among other prerequisites, entails declaration of a strike by vote of a majority \"of all the bona fide employees of all classes of an employer\" for the limited purpose of obtaining or resisting \"a change in wages, hours or conditions of their employment after demands made therefor\", is authorized to \"carry an arm band or other banner\" of a limited size which is required to set forth \"(i) the name or initials of the organization represented by the person wearing or carrying such arm band or other banner, and (ii) the word 'picket'\", and such arm band or banner, may, says the ordinance, \"also set forth (iii) the statement that a strike is in progress at the place of business so being picketed, including the name or address of such place of business, but such arm band or other banner shall have thereon no other words, lettering, numbering, picture or design whatsoever\". The word \"banner\" is defined, in such ordinance [section 1 (e)] to \"mean and include, but not be limited to, any banner, transparency, paper, sign, insignia, badge, emblem, symbol, ribbon, card, picture, arm banner, band or sign, hat band or sign, sash, waist band, banner or sign\". Section 5, otherwise than as limited by sections 4 and 6, declares that \"It shall be unlawful for any person to carry, show or display any banner in or upon [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 770] any public place, or in or upon any private place within the view of any person who is in or upon any public place, in front of, in the vicinity of, or about any place of business, or any of the approaches ... (ii) in a manner calculated or with the intent to induce or influence any person to refrain from entering, occupying or leaving any place of business\" or, generally, from having any transaction therewith or therein. Lastly, for the purposes of this premise, section 4 (c) provides that \"The activity of any such bona fide employee while so picketing such place of business shall be limited to patrolling upon the public places in front of or about such place of business and to wearing or carrying such an arm band or other banner as is permitted by section 6.\"</p>\n<p> Thus we see that the ordinance, among other things, (1) permits a majority of all classes of employees to symbolize or otherwise express (under the conditions prescribed) their statement that a strike is in progress but denies that right to a minority; (2) permits \"a bona fide employee\" (on conditions) to \"picket\" but denies that right to any person who has not been continuously employed by the employer for not less than 30 days; (3) permits the majority (on conditions) to state on a banner that a strike is in progress but denies them the right to make that statement orally; (4) permits the majority to say (on conditions on a banner) that a strike is in progress but strictly censors what they may say concerning that fact; (5) permits a majority to advertise (on conditions) by picketing that a dispute between employees and employer exists but forbids both majority and minority, at the time and place, or in the manner, of such advertising, to express their views or present arguments on the merits, or even to define the grounds, of the dispute. Furthermore, by such ordinance (6) not only are all persons generally forbidden to \"picket\", which means that they may not walk or ride back and forth or sit, stand or remain in the vicinity of the place of business involved, except on the conditions and with the qualifications prescribed, but also, by the strict terms of the law, no person--not even a regularly employed newsboy--\"upon any public place, or in or upon any private place within the view of any person who is in or upon any public place, in front of, in the vicinity of, or about any place of business ... in a manner calculated or with the intent to induce or influence [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 771] any person to refrain from entering, occupying or leaving any place of business\" or, generally, to refrain from having any transaction therein or therewith, may carry, show or display any \"paper\" (secs. 1 (e), 4 (c), 5 and 6). A newspaper or handbill carrying the story of a labor dispute and expressing the claims of either side would clearly be prohibited from display to the public (whether on public or private property) in the vicinity of a place of business at which a strike was in progress. The practical effect of the sum of the foregoing epitomized elements of the \"regulation\" is a comprehensive prohibition of the exercise by an individual, in the vicinity of a strike, of his freedom of speech and publication.</p>\n<p> It seems a work of supererogation to cite authorities, other than Amendments Numbers I and XIV of the United States Constitution, and section 9, article I, of the Constitution of California, to the point that each of the six propositions above enumerated, as well as their combined effect, is constitutionally untenable. It is elementary that the individual's or minority's right to exercise freedom of speech is not a privilege or a provisional property which is subject to the control of the majority; on the contrary, it is an essential characteristic of our constitutional democracy that that right, like those of freedom of press and peaceable assembly, shall perdure, inherent and implicit in the individual, subject to personal responsibility for abuse and to reasonable and necessary regulation as to time and place and circumstances, but not, as such, in scope or content, of exercise. As was said by Mr. Justice Brandeis (joined by Mr. Justice Holmes) in concurring in Whitney v. California, (1926) 274 U.S. 357, 377, 378 [47 S.Ct. 641, 71 L.Ed. 1095, 1106, 1107], \"Fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free speech and assembly. Men feared witches and burned women. It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears. ... Prohibition of free speech and assembly is a measure so stringent that it would be inappropriate as the means for averting a relatively trivial harm to society. A police measure may be unconstitutional merely because the remedy, although effective as means of protection, is unduly harsh or oppressive. ... The fact that speech is likely to result in some violence or in destruction of property is not enough to justify its suppression. There must be the probability of [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 772] serious injury to the state.\" And to the same effect is this language in Herndon v. Lowry, (1937) 301 U.S. 242, 258 [57 S.Ct. 732, 81 L.Ed. 1066, 1075], \"The power of a state to abridge freedom of speech and of assembly is the exception rather that [sic] the rule and the penalizing even of utterances of a defined character must find its justification in a reasonable apprehension of danger to organized government. The judgment of the legislature is not unfettered. The limitation upon individual liberty must have appropriate relation to the safety of the state. Legislation which goes beyond this need violates the principle of the Constitution.\"</p>\n<p> \"Democracy\", aptly says United States Commissioner of Education John W. Studebaker, at page 135 in \"Plain Talk\" (National Home Library Foundation, 1936), \"is a technique by which the will of the majority becomes law, and by which the right of the minority to attempt to become the majority by peaceful means is scrupulously protected.\" If we accept that definition, then we must acknowledge the right of the minority striker to \"attempt to become the majority by peaceful means\", and we are bound to scrupulously protect that right. While picketing, like other personal activities, is, as heretofore observed, subject to reasonable regulation in its exercise, I find nothing in the California Constitution to make inapplicable or inappropriate the statement of the United States Supreme Court in Senn v. Tile Layers Protective Union, (1937)301 U.S. 468, 481, 482 [57 S.Ct. 857, 81 L.Ed. 1229, 1238], that \"There is nothing in the Federal Constitution which forbids unions from competing with non-union concerns for customers by means of picketing as freely as one merchant competes with another merchant by means of advertisements in the press, by circulars, or by his window displays.\" We have here no question as to absolute prohibition, under the police power, of a vicious or non-useful act--the ordinance, in so far as the provisions under consideration are concerned, is manifestly intended and expressed to be regulatory of a recognized lawful and useful activity. The police power--the source of authority for most legislative remedies for municipal ills --is one of the most essential powers of government and one that is the least limitable (5 Cal.Jur. 687), but to be valid as affecting a useful and innocent endeavor it may not go beyond reasonable regulation (5 Cal.Jur. 709); the Constitution fixes its outermost limits. To retain the character [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 773] of being merely regulatory, legislation must not arbitrarily prohibit the exercise of any right and even if otherwise validly regulatory it will, as a general rule, fall if it at all impairs or unnecessarily impedes the exercise of a fundamental personal liberty such as a freedom of speech. Certainly it will be held void if it unnecessarily or harshly impairs that liberty; it should be so held for two reasons: (1) Whatever the ill such a remedy is not constitutionally available and (2) if it were available the remedy would be worse than the ill.</p>\n<p> While a law may be valid which in effect punishes the use of language which has the effect of inciting the unlawful use of violence or the commission of crime (Stromberg v. California (1931) 283 U.S. 359, 368, 369, [51 S.Ct. 532, 75 L.Ed. 1117, 1123, 73 A.L.R. 1484]), the end may not (save possibly in such extraordinary situations as are mentioned in the authority next hereinafter cited) be attained through the medium of censorship or previous restraint. (Near v. Minnesota, (1930) 283 U.S. 697, 716, 719, 720 [51 S.Ct. 625, 75 L.Ed. 1357, 1367, 1369]; Lovell v. Griffin, (1938) 303 U.S. 444, 451 [58 S.Ct. 666, 82 L.Ed. 949, 953]; Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, (1939) 307 U.S. 496 [59 S.Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423].) \"These rights [freedom of speech, press and assembly] may be abused by using speech or press or assembly in order to incite to violence and crime. The people through their legislatures [or by the initiative] may protect themselves against that abuse. But the legislative intervention can find constitutional justification only by dealing with the abuse. The rights themselves must not be curtailed.\" (DeJonge v. Oregon, (1936) 299 U.S. 353, 364, 365 [57 S.Ct. 255, 81 L.Ed. 287, 284].)</p>\n<p> It is suggested by my learned associates that the proposition I have discussed is not raised by the facts of the cases before us. I cannot agree with that suggestion.</p>\n<p> My opinion that picketing in general partakes of the nature of an expression or publication of an idea has already been stated and as to the more specific provisions of the ordinance which have been mentioned, although no defendant on this appeal is charged, in his picketing, with making an oral statement regarding an industrial dispute, with stating orally or on a banner or paper any fact censored by the ordinance, or with otherwise offending than is [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 774] denoted by the broad term \"picketing\", I think that, in appraising the constitutional validity of the ordinance in so far as any of its regulatory features directly or incidentally affects freedom of speech, it is proper to examine not an isolated segment but all the component parts affecting that particular liberty. By so doing we can the better determine whether the precise and directly pertinent impingement on such liberty is an inconsequential impediment or a substantial impairment. As we held in People v. Tilkin, (1939) 34 Cal.App.2d Supp. 743 [90 PaCal.2d 148], that \"to discover the creation of these crimes in the ordinance, section 4 must be added to section 3, and sections 4 and 6 added to section 5\", so here, to fairly ascertain how and to what extent, and whether validly in these cases the ordinance directly or incidentally regulates or curbs freedom of speech, we should add sections 4, 5 and 6 to section 1, and thus view the forest instead of only the single sapling. From viewing the forest, I conclude that the sapling does not merit propagation--it can bear no fruit. By the standards of civil liberty, in each of the cases now before us, the provisions of the ordinance on which each respective conviction is based are void, not only for the reasons elucidated in Mr. Presiding Judge Shaw's opinion, but also in that each of such provisions transgresses, in the particulars hereinabove delineated, the irremissibly vetitive provisions of Amendment Number XIV of the United States Constitution, making applicable here the rights declared in Amendment I, and of section 9, article I, California Constitution.</p>\n<p> On August 16, 1939, the Appellate Department of the Superior Court denied a rehearing, and filed the following opinion:</p>\n<p> The Court.</p>\n<p> [4] By petition for rehearing, respondent urges that there is no common-law right to picket, even peacefully, and hence the ordinance in question does not deprive would-be picketers of any right they would otherwise have, and apparently this is deemed to furnish a reason why a discrimination, even though arbitrary and unreasonable, may be made in the ordinance without subjecting it to objection on that ground. We are somewhat at a loss to know what is meant by the statement that there is no common-law right to picket in California. Certainly, in the absence of legislative prohibition or judicial restraint, [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 775] any person may use the public streets and other public places for walking or patrolling to and fro, or for standing, sitting or remaining, in front of any place of business, or doing any of the other acts comprehended within the definition of picketing given in this ordinance, or may, if the term \"picketing\" is used in the broader sense adverted to in Judge Schauer's concurring opinion, use his picketing as a means of uttering, conveying or publishing an idea, and no act of legislation is needed to confer upon him the right to do so. (We are, of course, not referring to possible violations, by persons so picketing, of laws directed at other sorts of conduct.) But were it otherwise, a legislative act which undertakes to confer a privilege on any class of citizens is subject to section 21, article I of our state Constitution, quoted in our opinion, and also to the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p> [5] We are also reminded by respondent that majority rule is a fundamental tenet of our constitutional system. This may be so, but it is not universally applicable. As suggested in Judge Schauer's concurring opinion, the Bill of Rights has numerous provisions whose purpose and effect is to prevent a majority from imposing their will on a minority in matters deemed of sufficient importance to justify such protection. Our attention is further called to various other purposes for which a majority classification has been used. When a matter of classification is involved, the question is not, is the classification valid for any or some purposes, but is it valid for the particular purpose for which it is used. The general use of a majority vote as the means of determining ordinary elections, or its adoption for selection of a bargaining agent for the employees in a business, or its use by a labor union in determining whether to strike, all of which have been referred to, may be proper enough for the purposes there in hand, but it does not follow that the same criterion may be used for the quite different purposes of this ordinance. In our opinion, it has no rational relation to those purposes.</p>\n<p> [6] It is also insisted that we have overlooked the rule that in the absence of facts proved in the case or judicially known on which to base a decision holding a law invalid, a court must presume that there were facts known to the legislative agency which justify it and warrant the classification made. We have had this rule in mind. But the [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 776] court may take notice of the propensities and tendencies of mankind, and of their manifestations as disclosed by current history. We cannot avoid the knowledge that, at least in this country, the great bulk of the picketing in labor disputes has been done by employees who have gone on strike, that many of the most serious riots, acts of violence and other breaches of the peace which have occurred in such cases have happened where a majority or more of the employees at some place of business had struck, and that the participation of picketing employees is such affairs, whether as actors or victims, has not been substantially less, in proportion to their numbers, than that of other persons acting in sympathy with them. In the face of those facts a limitation of picketing to employees and to cases where a majority of employees are on strike, permitting it where those conditions exist and prohibiting it elsewhere, cannot have any reasonable relation to the legislative purposes embodied in this ordinance. That those purposes are as stated in our opinion is not disputed in the petition for rehearing, and we see no reason to doubt the correctness of our conclusion thereon.</p>\n<p> The petition of respondent for a rehearing is denied in both of the above-entitled cases.</p>\n</div>","html_columbia":null,"html_with_citations":"<div>\n<center><b><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Tilkin, (1939) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1234787\"><a href=\"/opinion/1234787/people-v-tilkin/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></a></span> [90 PaCal.2d 148], and each of the complaints was framed in accordance with our decision there, in such form that each presents the question of the validity of a separate set of provisions of this ordinance.</p>\n<p> The ordinance contains in section 1 certain definitions, those material here being as follows:</p>\n<p> \"(a) The term 'to picket' shall mean and include to walk, march, patrol or ride to and fro, back and forth, or in any other repeated or successive or continuous manner, or to stand, sit or remain, in front of, in the vicinity of, or about any place of business, any place of residence, or any of the approaches leading thereto or therefrom.\"</p>\n<p> \"(c) The term 'bona fide strike' shall mean and include any cessation of work by at least a majority of all of the bona fide employees of all classes of an employer in order to obtain or resist a change in wages, hours or conditions of their employment after demands made therefor on such employer, [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 761] which cessation of work has taken place after a majority of all of the bona fide employees of all classes of such employer have by secret ballot voted to strike. A bona fide strike may exist against such employer generally, or may exist only at one or more of the separate places of business of such employer. In the latter case this subsection (c) shall be applied and interpreted, with respect to the determination of 'bona fide employees' and 'majority', as if the place or places of business at which said bona fide strike exists were the only place or places of business of such employer.\"</p>\n<p> \"(d) The term 'bona fide employee' of any employer shall mean a real person (1) who is employed by such employer and has been continuously employed by such employer for a period of not less than thirty (30) days, or (2) who was employed by such employer and had been continuously employed by such employer for a period of not less than thirty (30) days at the time a majority of such bona fide employees of such employer voted for or commenced a bona fide strike against such employer; but shall not include any employee or former employee of an employer if such employee or former employee shall have entered such employment for the purpose of picketing or of creating an industrial dispute or strike.\"</p>\n<p> Other material parts of the ordinance were set forth in People v. Tilkin, supra, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1234787\"><a href=\"/opinion/1234787/people-v-tilkin/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></a></span> [90 PaCal.2d 148], and will not be repeated here in full. The prohibitions here in question appear in sections 3 and 4, which, as we held in People v. Tilkin, are to be construed together and create a considerable number of separate offenses, the various provisions of section 4 being regarded as parts of the definitions of these offenses, and not mere exceptions to section 3. The provision of section 3 which is a part of the charge in each of these cases refers to picketing on a public street \"in a manner calculated ... to induce or influence any person to refrain from entering, occupying or leaving any place of business, or to refrain from performing services or labor, or to refrain from seeking or obtaining employment, or to refrain from purchasing, selling, using, delivering, transporting or receiving any goods, wares, merchandise, services, entertainment, accomodations or articles\". Section 4, as construed in People v. Tilkin, supra, adds to this description, in completion of the definition of one [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 762] of the offenses created by these sections--that charged here in People v. Gidaly, Cr. A. No. 1602--provision that picketing shall not be done in the manner described in section 3 at a place of business where there is no \"bona fide strike\", and adds, in completing the definition of another offense--that charged in count II of the complaint in People v. Aragon, Cr. A. No. 1607--provision that picketing shall not be so done by any person who is not a \"bona fide employee\" at the place picketed. Count I of the last-mentioned complaint charged an offense of which the defendants were found not guilty.</p>\n<p> The facts in each case are undisputed and were presented to the trial court by a written stipulation. In People v. Gidaly, it appears that the place of business picketed had twenty \"bona fide\" employees, that seventeen of them remained at work and three struck for higher wages. These facts prevented the strike from being \"bona fide\" within the definition above quoted. Appellant Gidaly, who picketed this place of business, was one of the three strikers. In People v. Aragon there was a strike in which thirty of the thirty-two employees took part, and there is no showing that it was for any reason not \"bona fide\", but two of the appellants who picketed the place of business where the strike occurred were not and never had been employees there, being union organizers, and the third had been employed there continuously for only 24 days at the time of the strike. These three appellants were therefore not \"bona fide\" employees within the terms of the ordinance.</p>\n<p> There is no contention in either case that the stipulated facts do not support the charge made, but both of the ordinance provisions on which the charges are based are attacked on constitutional grounds, one of which is that the classifications made by the ordinance in its definitions of \"bona fide strike\" and \"bona fide employee\", above quoted, are unreasonable and arbitrary and hence in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, particularly its provision forbidding a denial of the equal protection of the laws, and also of the provisions of the California Constitution. This contention must be sustained.</p>\n<p> [1] In passing on the matter, we begin with two propositions. In the first place, whatever desire the framers of this ordinance may have had to discourage strikes, they gave no expression to any such desire by incorporating in [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 763] the ordinance any prohibition of strikes. Neither this ordinance nor any other of which we are advised, nor any state law, forbids strikes. The right to strike is fully recognized in California. (Parkinson v. Building Trades Council, (1908) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></span>, 599 [98 P. 1027, 16 Ann. Cas. 1165, 21 L.R.A. (N. S.) 550]; Lisse v.

In the second place, the ordinance before us, as we held in People v. Tilkin, supra, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1234787\"><a href=\"/opinion/1234787/people-v-tilkin/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></a></span> [90 PaCal.2d 148, 153], has as its purpose the regulation, not the suppression of picketing, which it recognizes as a proper instrumentality for use in labor disputes. In pursuance of its purpose, and to set up criteria for determining who may picket and under what circumstances it may be done, classifications have been made by the ordinance, and the only question we have to pass upon is that of their validity.</p>\n<p> [2] The rules governing the validity of legislative classification under the Fourteenth Amendment are well settled. That amendment applies to city ordinances. (Home Tel. etc. Co. v. Los Angeles, (1913) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97779\"><a href=\"/opinion/97779/home-telephone-telegraph-co-v-los-angeles/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>, 294 [33 S.Ct. 312, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></span>, 518].) \"In order, however, that a statute shall be valid which contains a classification of persons or things for the purpose of legislation, such classification must be a reasonable one, and must be based on real distinctions in the subject matter which bear some relation to the object sought to be accomplished by the statute.\" (12 Cor. Jur. 1148, 1149.) \"The equal protection guaranteed by the Constitution forbids the legislature to select a person, natural or artificial, and impose upon him or it burdens and liabilities which are not cast upon others similarly situated. ... Neither can it make a classification of individuals or corporations which is purely arbitrary, and impose upon such class special burdens and liabilities. Even where the selection is not obviously unreasonable and arbitrary, if the discrimination is based upon matters which have no relation to the object sought to be accomplished, the same conclusion of unconstitutionality is affirmed.\" (Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. R. Co. v. Matthews, (1899) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95050\"><a href=\"/opinion/95050/atchison-t-sfr-co-v-matthews/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 104, 105 [19 S.Ct. 609, 43 L.Ed. 909].) \"While the difference need not be great, the classification must not be arbitrary or capricious, but must bear some just and reasonable relation to the object of the legislation.\" (Bayside Fish etc. Co. v. [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 764] Gentry, (1936) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102614\"><a href=\"/opinion/102614/bayside-fish-flour-co-v-gentry/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span>, 429 [56 S.Ct. 513, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></span>, 777].)</p>\n<p> The same principles have been established by the California decisions in applying to city ordinances and other legislation the provisions of section 21 of article I of the state Constitution that \"No special privileges or immunities shall ever be granted which may not be altered, revoked, or repealed by the legislature; nor shall any citizen, or class of citizens, be granted privileges or immunities which, upon the same terms, shall not be granted to all citizens.\" The Supreme Court said of this provision in In re Blois, (1918) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></span>, 295 [176 P. 449], \"This latter section of the Constitution has been given direct application to statutes and ordinances which have been enacted and sought to be enforced either by the state or by political subdivisions thereof, and in which attempts have been made to discriminate in favor of or against particular persons or classes of persons as to whom no reasonable basis of discrimination can be seen to exist; and in all such cases the courts of this state have uniformly held such attempted legislation to be void.\" In In re Sumida, (1918) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></span>, 391 [170 P. 823], the court, dealing with a city ordinance, quoted the following language from Ex parte Miller, (1912) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></span>, 698 [124 P. 427]: \"'A law is general and uniform in its operation when it applies equally to all persons, embraced within the class to which it is addressed, provided such class is made upon some natural, intrinsic or constitutional distinction between the persons composing it and others not embraced in it. ... The difference on which the classification is based must be such as, in some reasonable degree, will account for or justify the peculiar legislation.'\" In Martin v.

That is to say, not only must the class itself be germane to the purpose of the law but the individual components of the class must be characterized by some substantial qualities or attribute which suggest the need for and the propriety of the legislation.\" See, also, Gaetano Bocci &amp; Sons Co. v.

As already stated, the part of the ordinance involved in People v. Gidaly, Cr. A. No. 1602, is that prohibiting picketing of a place of business where less than a majority are on strike, and People v. Aragon, Cr. A. No. 1607, involves that part of it prohibiting picketing by persons who are not or have not been continuously for at least thirty days employees at the place of business picketed. To sum up the effect of these provisions, if a majority of the \"bona fide\" employees at a place of business or at all the employer's places of business, go on strike, such place may be picketed, but if less than that number strike none of them may picket; and no matter how many strike, persons not employees may not join them in picketing and employees who have been such less than thirty days continuously may not picket. How do these discriminations tend to promote the objects of the ordinance? Those objects, as we gather them from a consideration of its various prohibitions, are, first, to prevent obstruction of streets and other public places, and other interference with their use for passage; second, to prevent, in labor disputes, acts of intimidation and violence directed at persons engaged in those disputes or at other members of the public; and, third, to assure to the public and those affected by such disputes freedom from unlawful disturbance and annoyance arising from picketing.</p>\n<p> Considering the first of these objects, it is manifest that it can make no difference whether a picket is or has been [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 766] for thirty days an employee of the place picketed, and that interference with passage over the streets is not less likely when a majority of the employees are on strike. Moreover, that object seems well accomplished by section 10, which prohibits a variety of acts which would hinder or prevent free passage along streets and other public places. As to the second and third objects, we note that sections 7, 8, and 9 of the ordinance prohibit any person, be he picket or not, from engaging in acts of intimidation or coercion in connection with any place of business, section 2 thereof specially forbids pickets to do so, and sections 7, 8, and 9 prohibit also a variety of acts which might amount to mere annoyance or disturbance. With the activities of pickets thus limited, what difference can it make to the accomplishment of the objects of this ordinance whether or not they are employees at all or have been such for any particular length of time, or how many of the employees at the place picketed are on strike? We can see no such difference.</p>\n<p> Even were there no such other limitations on pickets, the classifications now under consideration would have no just or reasonable relation to the objects of the legislation, to use the phraseology of Bayside Fish etc. Co. v. Gentry, supra, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102614\"><a href=\"/opinion/102614/bayside-fish-flour-co-v-gentry/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span>, 429, [56 S.Ct. 513, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></span>, 777]. There is nothing in any experience to which our attention has been called and we see nothing in reason to suggest that pickets at a place where a minority of the employees are on strike will be any more given to violence, obstruction of streets, intimidation, annoyance and disturbance than those where a majority strike. Neither does it appear that the length of time a picket has been employed at the place he pickets bears any rational relation to the probability of his acting in a manner contravening the objects of this ordinance. We find no rational ground to suppose that a picket who is not employed at the place picketed, who may be a friend or relative of an employee, a person hired for the purpose, or an official of some union interested in the strike, will be any more active or urgent about the business of picketing or any more likely to engage in obnoxious conduct, than an employee. The latter has a personal interest in winning the strike, which furnishes him as strong an incentive to let the end justify the means, as any other picket is likely to have. The provision of the ordinance discriminating between employees and others and denying the latter [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 767] the right to picket, comes directly within this declaration made by the United States Supreme Court, arguendo, in Truax v. Corrigan, (1921) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99887\"><a href=\"/opinion/99887/truax-v-corrigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 335 [42 S.Ct. 124, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></span>, 264, 27 A.L.R. 375, 387]: \"Suppose the legislature of the state were to provide that such acts as were here committed by defendants, to wit, the picketing or patrolling of the sidewalk and street in front of the store or business house of any person, and the use of handbills of an abusive and libelous character against the owner and present and future customers, with intent to injure the business of the owner, should be a public nuisance and be punishable by fine and imprisonment, and were to except ex-employees from its penal provisions. Is it not clear that any defendant could escape punishment under it on the ground that the statute violated the equality clause of the 14th Amendment? That is the necessary effect of Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95612\"><a href=\"/opinion/95612/connolly-v-union-sewer-pipe-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span> [46 L.Ed. 679, 22 S.Ct. 431].\"</p>\n<p> Again we call attention to the fact that in the situations selected by this ordinance for its permissive effect the picketing of a place of business may be done in such manner as is likely (and ordinarily its object would be) to induce persons not to enter or leave the place, not to work or seek employment there, and not to buy, sell, deliver or receive goods there, subject to other provisions of the ordinance against violence, coercion, intimidation and annoyance and some other limitations not now requiring consideration. No question arises as to the prohibition of such picketing altogether, for there is no such prohibition, but only as to the reasonableness of the standards bY which the ordinance has selected the persons by whom and the circumstances under which it may be done. By the established rules of constitutional law, such standards may not be arbitrary, but must have some reasonable relation to the object and purpose of the ordinance. Finding no such relation, we hold the prohibitions here in question invalid. The ordinance makes other discriminations, not here discussed, in its definitions of \"bona fide strike\" and \"bona fide employee\". The facts of these cases do not raise any question of the validity of those other discriminations, for it does not appear that any of the appellants is in any of the classes against whom such discriminations run. We have for that reason refrained from expressing an opinion regarding any of the other [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 768] discriminations. For similar reasons we do not decide upon the validity of various other provisions of the ordinance not involved in the charges made against the defendants.</p>\n<p> The judgments are reversed and the causes are remanded to the municipal court, with directions to dismiss the complaint in People v. Gidaly, Cr. A. No. 1602, and to dismiss count 2 of the complaint in People v. Aragon, Cr. A. No. 1607. The appeal from the order denying motion to quash and dismiss the complaint, in Cr. A. No. 1607, is dismissed.</p>\n<p> Bishop, J., concurred.</p>\n<p> Schauer, J.,</p>\n<p> Concurring.</p>\n<p> I concur. I am in accord with the conclusion reached by my associates, and with the propositions of law which support it, but think, however, that as an even more fundamental and essential constitutional right (than that which is made the basis of the foregoing opinion) has been discussed by counsel in presenting this case and is pertinent to this decision, that it should not go unmentioned in our opinion. I refer to the right of free speech together also with the independent but constitutionally cognate and equal rights of freedom of press and peaceable assembly. (U.S. Const., Amendments I and XIV.) Amendment I of the United States Constitution, which declares those liberties, is, in effect, made operative on the several states by Amendment XIV (Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, (1939) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103226\"><a href=\"/opinion/103226/hague-mayor-v-committee-for-industrial-organization/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span> [59 S.Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423]; see, also, Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stats. at L. 13) and such rights are redeclared in the California Constitution (sec. 9, art. I).</p>\n<p> One cannot read the provisions of the ordinance here involved without knowing that it affects those constitutional rights in some measure. As was stated in the \"Affirmative Argument on Proposition No. 1 to Regulate Picketing\", which was a paper officially mailed to the voters preceding the September 16, 1938, election, at which the ordinance was adopted, \"The primary purpose of picketing is to advertise a dispute between employer and employees.\" As the \"display of a flag or banner 'as a sign, symbol or emblem of opposition to organized government'\" constitutes an exercise of the right of freedom of speech (Stromberg v. California, (1931) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></span>, 365 [51 S.Ct. 532, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></span>, [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 769] 1121, 73 A.L.R. 1484]), so does picketing, to advertise a dispute between employees and employer, like other methods of expression or means of publication, likewise constitute an exercise of that right. Since it may differ, in its forms of manifestation, from the ordinary spoken or printed word, it may well be subject to reasonable regulations which might not be appropriate to the latter, but it is important that we frankly recognize it as a form of exercise of the fundamental liberty of speaking, writing and publishing one's views so that we shall not misapprehend the standards by which the validity of any regulations affecting it are to be tested. Pertinently, I find that the regulations involved in these cases cannot be sustained when so tested.</p>\n<p> The term \"to picket\" is defined, in the ordinance, to include walking or riding back and forth, or standing, sitting or remaining, in front or in the vicinity of, any place of business or residence or its approaches. A \"bona fide employee\" is one who, among other things, has been continuously employed by the employer, for not less than 30 days. On conditions enumerated a \"bona fide employee while carrying on lawful picketing\", which, among other prerequisites, entails declaration of a strike by vote of a majority \"of all the bona fide employees of all classes of an employer\" for the limited purpose of obtaining or resisting \"a change in wages, hours or conditions of their employment after demands made therefor\", is authorized to \"carry an arm band or other banner\" of a limited size which is required to set forth \"(i) the name or initials of the organization represented by the person wearing or carrying such arm band or other banner, and (ii) the word 'picket'\", and such arm band or banner, may, says the ordinance, \"also set forth (iii) the statement that a strike is in progress at the place of business so being picketed, including the name or address of such place of business, but such arm band or other banner shall have thereon no other words, lettering, numbering, picture or design whatsoever\". The word \"banner\" is defined, in such ordinance [section 1 (e)] to \"mean and include, but not be limited to, any banner, transparency, paper, sign, insignia, badge, emblem, symbol, ribbon, card, picture, arm banner, band or sign, hat band or sign, sash, waist band, banner or sign\". Section 5, otherwise than as limited by sections 4 and 6, declares that \"It shall be unlawful for any person to carry, show or display any banner in or upon [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 770] any public place, or in or upon any private place within the view of any person who is in or upon any public place, in front of, in the vicinity of, or about any place of business, or any of the approaches ... (ii) in a manner calculated or with the intent to induce or influence any person to refrain from entering, occupying or leaving any place of business\" or, generally, from having any transaction therewith or therein. Lastly, for the purposes of this premise, section 4 (c) provides that \"The activity of any such bona fide employee while so picketing such place of business shall be limited to patrolling upon the public places in front of or about such place of business and to wearing or carrying such an arm band or other banner as is permitted by section 6.\"</p>\n<p> Thus we see that the ordinance, among other things, (1) permits a majority of all classes of employees to symbolize or otherwise express (under the conditions prescribed) their statement that a strike is in progress but denies that right to a minority; (2) permits \"a bona fide employee\" (on conditions) to \"picket\" but denies that right to any person who has not been continuously employed by the employer for not less than 30 days; (3) permits the majority (on conditions) to state on a banner that a strike is in progress but denies them the right to make that statement orally; (4) permits the majority to say (on conditions on a banner) that a strike is in progress but strictly censors what they may say concerning that fact; (5) permits a majority to advertise (on conditions) by picketing that a dispute between employees and employer exists but forbids both majority and minority, at the time and place, or in the manner, of such advertising, to express their views or present arguments on the merits, or even to define the grounds, of the dispute. Furthermore, by such ordinance (6) not only are all persons generally forbidden to \"picket\", which means that they may not walk or ride back and forth or sit, stand or remain in the vicinity of the place of business involved, except on the conditions and with the qualifications prescribed, but also, by the strict terms of the law, no person--not even a regularly employed newsboy--\"upon any public place, or in or upon any private place within the view of any person who is in or upon any public place, in front of, in the vicinity of, or about any place of business ... in a manner calculated or with the intent to induce or influence [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 771] any person to refrain from entering, occupying or leaving any place of business\" or, generally, to refrain from having any transaction therein or therewith, may carry, show or display any \"paper\" (secs. 1 (e), 4 (c), 5 and 6). A newspaper or handbill carrying the story of a labor dispute and expressing the claims of either side would clearly be prohibited from display to the public (whether on public or private property) in the vicinity of a place of business at which a strike was in progress. The practical effect of the sum of the foregoing epitomized elements of the \"regulation\" is a comprehensive prohibition of the exercise by an individual, in the vicinity of a strike, of his freedom of speech and publication.</p>\n<p> It seems a work of supererogation to cite authorities, other than Amendments Numbers I and XIV of the United States Constitution, and section 9, article I, of the Constitution of California, to the point that each of the six propositions above enumerated, as well as their combined effect, is constitutionally untenable. It is elementary that the individual's or minority's right to exercise freedom of speech is not a privilege or a provisional property which is subject to the control of the majority; on the contrary, it is an essential characteristic of our constitutional democracy that that right, like those of freedom of press and peaceable assembly, shall perdure, inherent and implicit in the individual, subject to personal responsibility for abuse and to reasonable and necessary regulation as to time and place and circumstances, but not, as such, in scope or content, of exercise. As was said by Mr. Justice Brandeis (joined by Mr. Justice Holmes) in concurring in Whitney v. California, (1926) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101097\"><a href=\"/opinion/101097/whitney-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span>, 377, 378 [47 S.Ct. 641, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1095</span></span>, 1106, 1107], \"Fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free speech and assembly. Men feared witches and burned women. It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears. ... Prohibition of free speech and assembly is a measure so stringent that it would be inappropriate as the means for averting a relatively trivial harm to society. A police measure may be unconstitutional merely because the remedy, although effective as means of protection, is unduly harsh or oppressive. ... The fact that speech is likely to result in some violence or in destruction of property is not enough to justify its suppression. There must be the probability of [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 772] serious injury to the state.\" And to the same effect is this language in Herndon v. Lowry, (1937) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102821\"><a href=\"/opinion/102821/herndon-v-lowry/\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span>, 258 [57 S.Ct. 732, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1066</span></span>, 1075], \"The power of a state to abridge freedom of speech and of assembly is the exception rather that [sic] the rule and the penalizing even of utterances of a defined character must find its justification in a reasonable apprehension of danger to organized government. The judgment of the legislature is not unfettered. The limitation upon individual liberty must have appropriate relation to the safety of the state. Legislation which goes beyond this need violates the principle of the Constitution.\"</p>\n<p> \"Democracy\", aptly says United States Commissioner of Education John W. Studebaker, at page 135 in \"Plain Talk\" (National Home Library Foundation, 1936), \"is a technique by which the will of the majority becomes law, and by which the right of the minority to attempt to become the majority by peaceful means is scrupulously protected.\" If we accept that definition, then we must acknowledge the right of the minority striker to \"attempt to become the majority by peaceful means\", and we are bound to scrupulously protect that right. While picketing, like other personal activities, is, as heretofore observed, subject to reasonable regulation in its exercise, I find nothing in the California Constitution to make inapplicable or inappropriate the statement of the United States Supreme Court in Senn v. Tile Layers Protective Union, (1937)301 U.S. 468, 481, 482 [57 S.Ct. 857, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1229</span></span>, 1238], that \"There is nothing in the Federal Constitution which forbids unions from competing with non-union concerns for customers by means of picketing as freely as one merchant competes with another merchant by means of advertisements in the press, by circulars, or by his window displays.\" We have here no question as to absolute prohibition, under the police power, of a vicious or non-useful act--the ordinance, in so far as the provisions under consideration are concerned, is manifestly intended and expressed to be regulatory of a recognized lawful and useful activity. The police power--the source of authority for most legislative remedies for municipal ills --is one of the most essential powers of government and one that is the least limitable (5 Cal.Jur. 687), but to be valid as affecting a useful and innocent endeavor it may not go beyond reasonable regulation (5 Cal.Jur. 709); the Constitution fixes its outermost limits. To retain the character [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 773] of being merely regulatory, legislation must not arbitrarily prohibit the exercise of any right and even if otherwise validly regulatory it will, as a general rule, fall if it at all impairs or unnecessarily impedes the exercise of a fundamental personal liberty such as a freedom of speech. Certainly it will be held void if it unnecessarily or harshly impairs that liberty; it should be so held for two reasons: (1) Whatever the ill such a remedy is not constitutionally available and (2) if it were available the remedy would be worse than the ill.</p>\n<p> While a law may be valid which in effect punishes the use of language which has the effect of inciting the unlawful use of violence or the commission of crime (Stromberg v. California (1931) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101741\"><a href=\"/opinion/101741/stromberg-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span>, 368, 369, [51 S.Ct. 532, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></span>, 1123, 73 A.L.R. 1484]), the end may not (save possibly in such extraordinary situations as are mentioned in the authority next hereinafter cited) be attained through the medium of censorship or previous restraint. (Near v. Minnesota, (1930) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></span>, 716, 719, 720 [51 S.Ct. 625, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

The people through their legislatures [or by the initiative] may protect themselves against that abuse. But the legislative intervention can find constitutional justification only by dealing with the abuse. The rights themselves must not be curtailed.\" (DeJonge v. Oregon, (1936) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102728\"><a href=\"/opinion/102728/de-jonge-v-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span>, 364, 365 [57 S.Ct. 255, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></span>, 284].)</p>\n<p> It is suggested by my learned associates that the proposition I have discussed is not raised by the facts of the cases before us. I cannot agree with that suggestion.</p>\n<p> My opinion that picketing in general partakes of the nature of an expression or publication of an idea has already been stated and as to the more specific provisions of the ordinance which have been mentioned, although no defendant on this appeal is charged, in his picketing, with making an oral statement regarding an industrial dispute, with stating orally or on a banner or paper any fact censored by the ordinance, or with otherwise offending than is [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 774] denoted by the broad term \"picketing\", I think that, in appraising the constitutional validity of the ordinance in so far as any of its regulatory features directly or incidentally affects freedom of speech, it is proper to examine not an isolated segment but all the component parts affecting that particular liberty. By so doing we can the better determine whether the precise and directly pertinent impingement on such liberty is an inconsequential impediment or a substantial impairment. As we held in People v. Tilkin, (1939) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1234787\"><a href=\"/opinion/1234787/people-v-tilkin/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></a></span> [90 PaCal.2d 148], that \"to discover the creation of these crimes in the ordinance, section 4 must be added to section 3, and sections 4 and 6 added to section 5\", so here, to fairly ascertain how and to what extent, and whether validly in these cases the ordinance directly or incidentally regulates or curbs freedom of speech, we should add sections 4, 5 and 6 to section 1, and thus view the forest instead of only the single sapling. From viewing the forest, I conclude that the sapling does not merit propagation--it can bear no fruit. By the standards of civil liberty, in each of the cases now before us, the provisions of the ordinance on which each respective conviction is based are void, not only for the reasons elucidated in Mr. Presiding Judge Shaw's opinion, but also in that each of such provisions transgresses, in the particulars hereinabove delineated, the irremissibly vetitive provisions of Amendment Number XIV of the United States Constitution, making applicable here the rights declared in Amendment I, and of section 9, article I, California Constitution.</p>\n<p> On August 16, 1939, the Appellate Department of the Superior Court denied a rehearing, and filed the following opinion:</p>\n<p> The Court.</p>\n<p> [4] By petition for rehearing, respondent urges that there is no common-law right to picket, even peacefully, and hence the ordinance in question does not deprive would-be picketers of any right they would otherwise have, and apparently this is deemed to furnish a reason why a discrimination, even though arbitrary and unreasonable, may be made in the ordinance without subjecting it to objection on that ground. We are somewhat at a loss to know what is meant by the statement that there is no common-law right to picket in California. Certainly, in the absence of legislative prohibition or judicial restraint, [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 775] any person may use the public streets and other public places for walking or patrolling to and fro, or for standing, sitting or remaining, in front of any place of business, or doing any of the other acts comprehended within the definition of picketing given in this ordinance, or may, if the term \"picketing\" is used in the broader sense adverted to in Judge Schauer's concurring opinion, use his picketing as a means of uttering, conveying or publishing an idea, and no act of legislation is needed to confer upon him the right to do so. (We are, of course, not referring to possible violations, by persons so picketing, of laws directed at other sorts of conduct.) But were it otherwise, a legislative act which undertakes to confer a privilege on any class of citizens is subject to section 21, article I of our state Constitution, quoted in our opinion, and also to the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p> [5] We are also reminded by respondent that majority rule is a fundamental tenet of our constitutional system. This may be so, but it is not universally applicable. As suggested in Judge Schauer's concurring opinion, the Bill of Rights has numerous provisions whose purpose and effect is to prevent a majority from imposing their will on a minority in matters deemed of sufficient importance to justify such protection. Our attention is further called to various other purposes for which a majority classification has been used. When a matter of classification is involved, the question is not, is the classification valid for any or some purposes, but is it valid for the particular purpose for which it is used. The general use of a majority vote as the means of determining ordinary elections, or its adoption for selection of a bargaining agent for the employees in a business, or its use by a labor union in determining whether to strike, all of which have been referred to, may be proper enough for the purposes there in hand, but it does not follow that the same criterion may be used for the quite different purposes of this ordinance. In our opinion, it has no rational relation to those purposes.</p>\n<p> [6] It is also insisted that we have overlooked the rule that in the absence of facts proved in the case or judicially known on which to base a decision holding a law invalid, a court must presume that there were facts known to the legislative agency which justify it and warrant the classification made. We have had this rule in mind. But the [35 Cal.App.2d Supp. 776] court may take notice of the propensities and tendencies of mankind, and of their manifestations as disclosed by current history. We cannot avoid the knowledge that, at least in this country, the great bulk of the picketing in labor disputes has been done by employees who have gone on strike, that many of the most serious riots, acts of violence and other breaches of the peace which have occurred in such cases have happened where a majority or more of the employees at some place of business had struck, and that the participation of picketing employees is such affairs, whether as actors or victims, has not been substantially less, in proportion to their numbers, than that of other persons acting in sympathy with them. In the face of those facts a limitation of picketing to employees and to cases where a majority of employees are on strike, permitting it where those conditions exist and prohibiting it elsewhere, cannot have any reasonable relation to the legislative purposes embodied in this ordinance. That those purposes are as stated in our opinion is not disputed in the petition for rehearing, and we see no reason to doubt the correctness of our conclusion thereon.</p>\n<p> The petition of respondent for a rehearing is denied in both of the above-entitled cases.</p>\n</div>","extracted_by_ocr":false,"opinions_cited":["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/94591/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/95050/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/95612/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/97779/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/99887/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/101097/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/101741/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/102614/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/102728/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/102821/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/103226/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1167217/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1178834/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1234787/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2617943/"]},{"resource_uri":"https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1111644/","absolute_url":"/opinion/1111644/purcell-v-goldberg/","cluster":"https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/1111644/","author":null,"joined_by":[],"date_created":"2013-10-30T04:06:09.106981Z","date_modified":"2016-02-29T01:44:07.573906Z","type":"010combined","sha1":"3f4c881ea7130c2c86e6fa4cc6b4f475783421bd","download_url":null,"local_path":null,"plain_text":"","html":"","html_lawbox":"<div>\n<center><b>34 Cal.App.2d 344 (1939)</b></center>\n<center><h1>HAZEL PURCELL, Respondent,<br>\nv.<br>\nGARRETT M.

Wollitz for Respondent.</p>\n<p> Knight, J.</p>\n<p> Plaintiff brought this action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained when her automobile was struck and overturned by one owned by the defendant Goldberg and driven with his consent by the defendant Caler. The action was tried before a jury, and a verdict rendered in plaintiff's favor and against both defendants for $2,840.50. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*347</span> Judgment was entered accordingly, from which defendants appeal.</p>\n<p> The accident happened about 9 o'clock at night on a wide curve on Market Street extension in the vicinity of Twin Peaks in San Francisco. The highway in that locality is built on a grade, and divided by a white line into two traffic lanes. Caler, accompanied by a young lady companion, was ascending the grade, traveling up the inner lane at a speed of about thiry-five miles an hour, and following closely behind another car. As he was about to round the curve and when approximately ten feet distant from respondent, who was descending the grade traveling down the outer lane at a lawful speed, he suddenly shot from behind the car he was following, headed across the highway, and struck the tire on the left rear wheel of respondent's car, causing it to overturn three times. Meanwhile Caler's car continued on and across the highway and crashed into an electric light transmission pole, breaking the pole. The doctor at the emergency hospital to which the injured parties were taken immediately following the accident testified that Caler's breath was more or less alcoholic; but Caler claimed at the trial that it was the result of having eaten three brandied peaches with his dinner.</p>\n<p> [1] The first point urged in support of the appeal is that the accident was unavoidable. The contention made in this behalf is based on Caler's uncorroborated testimony that while rounding the curve he attempted to flick the ashes from the cigarette he was smoking, out of the partly opened window on his side of the car; that the ashes blew back into his eyes, temporarily blinding him and causing him to lose control of his car; and that he was not aware of the fact that he had collided with anyone until after he had crashed into the electric light pole. Manifestly, however, the question of the truth of the explanation so offered by him for having driven out of line and across the highway at that particular point was one exclusively for the determination of the jury. [2] In other words, the issue of unavoidable accident raised by his testimony was submitted to the jury by appellants under appropriate instructions proposed by them, and the jury as sole judge of the evidence, the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony, found adversely on that issue; and in view of all the existing conditions shown <span class=\"star-pagination\">*348</span> by the evidence it may well have concluded that it was a case of reckless attempt to pass another car traveling in the same direction, on a curve. In any event, the jury's implied adverse finding on the issue of unavoidable accident is necessarily final and conclusive on appeal.</p>\n<p> [3] In establishing Caler's condition at the time of the accident it was disclosed incidentally that his companion (who was not called as a witness) had not dined with him that evening, but that she too had an alcoholic breath; and appellants assign the admission of the testimony as error. It is quite evident, however, that in deciding the issue of unavoidable accident Caler's veracity as a witness as well as the extent of his alcoholic condition at the time he collided with respondent became of vital importance; and as declared by subdivision 3 of section 2061 of the Code of Civil Procedure, \"... a witness false in one part of his testimony is to be distrusted in others\". It would seem, therefore, as respondent contends, that the facts revealed by the disputed testimony related to matters the jury was entitled to weigh in determining whether, contrary to the story told by Caler, his alcoholic breath was caused by something stronger than three brandied peaches. In any event, and regardless of the purpose for which the testimony was offered, it is doubtless the law that in an action such as this, to recover damages based on alleged negligence, a plaintiff is allowed to prove and the jury should consider all of the circumstances present at the time of the happening of the accident (Craig v. Boyes, 123 Cal.App. 592 [11 PaCal.2d 673]), which here would include the condition of both occupants of the car that caused it.</p>\n<p> Appellants next complain of the giving and refusal to give numerous instructions; but we find nothing in the points so made which calls for reversal. [4] The first two instructions challenged used the words \"proximately contributed\" instead of \"proximately caused\". It appears, however, that the term \"proximate cause\" was clearly defined in other instructions and the jury fully advised as to the law relating thereto; consequently no error is shown. (Miner v. Dabney-Johnson Oil Corp., 219 Cal. 580 [28 PaCal.2d 23].) [5] Objection is made also to two instructions upon the ground that they were \"formula\" in character and omitted any reference to the defense of contributory negligence. We are satisfied that the omission complained of was not prejudicial. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*349</span> As held in substance in Brower v. Arnstein, 126 Cal.App. 291 [14 PaCal.2d 863], in a situation quite similar to the one here presented, where said so-called formula instructions, when separated from each other and from the general charge, omit some elements involved in the case, but the very method of the giving thereof indicates plainly that they were never intended and do not purport to state all of the several elements involved in the case as such in detail, but instead those omitted are made the subject of separate, specific instructions, the giving of such so-called formula instructions does not constitute prejudicial error. And in the present case, as will be seen from reading the entire charge of the court, the two instructions complained of were never intended as formula instructions. Each related to a single, distinct element; and neither purported to embody all of the necessary elements involved in the case. The subject of contributory negligence was specifically treated in other instructions, wherein the law relating thereto was completely and correctly stated; therefore it does not appear possible that the jury could have been misled by the two criticized. (Douglas v. Southern Pac. Co., 203 Cal. 390 [264 P. 237].) [6] Moreover, appellants failed to prove any substantial facts which would justify an inference of contributory negligence; and that being so, there can be no foundation for the claim of prejudicial error with respect to instructions bearing upon that subject. [7] Nor was there any error committed in giving the instruction regarding the application of the brakes of Caler's car, or the refusal to give those relating to statutory speed, because neither of those factors was made a material issue in the case. In any event, in view of the admitted fact that Caler lost control of his car and crashed into respondent's car on the other side of the highway, and the jury's apparent rejection of the explanation offered by him for his actions, it would seem obvious that none of the assignments of error regarding any of the instructions become important and in no event constitute ground for reversal.</p>\n<p> [8] The next point urged relates to the question of special damages. In this regard the record shows that at the opening of respondent's direct examination it was brought out that she was a public school teacher, married, and living with her husband; but the fact that she was a married woman was nowhere stated in the complaint; nor did she join her <span class=\"star-pagination\">*350</span> husband as party plaintiff. If further appears that the jury's award included special damages, among the items alleged, proved and recovered being physicians' and surgeons' fees, expenses of a housekeeper, and loss of earnings. Appellants contend, therefore, that under the circumstances the allowance of those items and the admission of the testimony and the giving of instructions pertaining thereto constituted error, the basis of their contention being that said items represented consequential damages to the community, which could be recovered only in an action in which the husband joined as plaintiff, or one brought by him alone. Such is not the present law. Section 370 of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended in 1921 declares in plain terms that \"A married woman ... may sue without her husband being joined as a party in all actions, including those for injury to her person ...\" (Italics ours.) Necessarily, therefore, the damages a married woman may recover in such an action include consequential as well as direct; and it was definitely so held in Fassett v. Nascimiento, 108 Cal.App. 14 [291 P. 269], wherein the factual situation was practically the same as the one here presented. The cases cited and relied on by appellants, including Meier v. Wagner, 27 Cal.App. 579 [150 P. 797], are not in point for the reason that they were based upon the law as it stood prior to the 1921 amendment to said section 370. [9] Nor was respondent precluded as a matter of law from recovering the amount of the medical fee incurred for the services of Dr. Winternitz merely because she belonged to an association with which he was connected, and which provided in its contract with its members that as such they were liable for the medical services only in case they recovered damages. (Reichle v. Hazie, 22 Cal.App.2d 543 [71 PaCal.2d 849].)</p>\n<p> The amount of general damages awarded by the jury was fixed apparently in the sum of $2,000; and appellants' final contention is that the sum allowed is excessive. [10] It is well settled, however, that this is a question that is committed largely to the discretion of the trial court and that its determination thereof may not be set aside on appeal unless it appears that the award is so disproportionate to the injuries received as to indicate that the award was the result of passion, prejudice or corruption of the jury. (Formosa v. Yellow Cab Co., 31 Cal.App.2d 77 [87 PaCal.2d 716].) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*351</span> [11] Here the evidence shows that prior to the accident respondent enjoyed reasonably good health, and that as the result of her car being overturned three times while she was in it she was badly bruised and sustained a severe nervous shock. She was able to leave the emergency hospital on the night of the accident without surgical treatment, but the evidence shows that thereafter she was confined to her home under the doctor's care for three weeks; that she suffered severe pains in the back of the neck and head, and was affected with nausea; and that on account of \"blinding headaches\" and nervous shock she was compelled to continue medical treatment for some time after being allowed to leave home. In describing her condition at the time of trial, one of the medical witnesses stated that she was then suffering from neurosis, a condition in which the nervous system shows a low reserve; that she was unable to \"pack the load\" as formerly, and that spontaneously with every physical effort she immediately develops \"symptoms of nervousness, irritability, and fatigability\"; and that in his opinion such condition would continue for an indefinite period. In view of the foregoing facts and under the established rules limiting the powers of the reviewing court in dealing with the matter of damages, there is no legal ground upon which it may be held that the sum awarded is as a matter of law so excessive as to warrant interference on appeal.</p>\n<p> The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p> Ward, J., and Peters, P.

Wollitz for Respondent.</p>\n<p> Knight, J.</p>\n<p> Plaintiff brought this action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained when her automobile was struck and overturned by one owned by the defendant Goldberg and driven with his consent by the defendant Caler. The action was tried before a jury, and a verdict rendered in plaintiff's favor and against both defendants for $2,840.50. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*347</span> Judgment was entered accordingly, from which defendants appeal.</p>\n<p> The accident happened about 9 o'clock at night on a wide curve on Market Street extension in the vicinity of Twin Peaks in San Francisco. The highway in that locality is built on a grade, and divided by a white line into two traffic lanes. Caler, accompanied by a young lady companion, was ascending the grade, traveling up the inner lane at a speed of about thiry-five miles an hour, and following closely behind another car. As he was about to round the curve and when approximately ten feet distant from respondent, who was descending the grade traveling down the outer lane at a lawful speed, he suddenly shot from behind the car he was following, headed across the highway, and struck the tire on the left rear wheel of respondent's car, causing it to overturn three times. Meanwhile Caler's car continued on and across the highway and crashed into an electric light transmission pole, breaking the pole. The doctor at the emergency hospital to which the injured parties were taken immediately following the accident testified that Caler's breath was more or less alcoholic; but Caler claimed at the trial that it was the result of having eaten three brandied peaches with his dinner.</p>\n<p> [1] The first point urged in support of the appeal is that the accident was unavoidable. The contention made in this behalf is based on Caler's uncorroborated testimony that while rounding the curve he attempted to flick the ashes from the cigarette he was smoking, out of the partly opened window on his side of the car; that the ashes blew back into his eyes, temporarily blinding him and causing him to lose control of his car; and that he was not aware of the fact that he had collided with anyone until after he had crashed into the electric light pole. Manifestly, however, the question of the truth of the explanation so offered by him for having driven out of line and across the highway at that particular point was one exclusively for the determination of the jury. [2] In other words, the issue of unavoidable accident raised by his testimony was submitted to the jury by appellants under appropriate instructions proposed by them, and the jury as sole judge of the evidence, the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony, found adversely on that issue; and in view of all the existing conditions shown <span class=\"star-pagination\">*348</span> by the evidence it may well have concluded that it was a case of reckless attempt to pass another car traveling in the same direction, on a curve. In any event, the jury's implied adverse finding on the issue of unavoidable accident is necessarily final and conclusive on appeal.</p>\n<p> [3] In establishing Caler's condition at the time of the accident it was disclosed incidentally that his companion (who was not called as a witness) had not dined with him that evening, but that she too had an alcoholic breath; and appellants assign the admission of the testimony as error. It is quite evident, however, that in deciding the issue of unavoidable accident Caler's veracity as a witness as well as the extent of his alcoholic condition at the time he collided with respondent became of vital importance; and as declared by subdivision 3 of section 2061 of the Code of Civil Procedure, \"... a witness false in one part of his testimony is to be distrusted in others\". It would seem, therefore, as respondent contends, that the facts revealed by the disputed testimony related to matters the jury was entitled to weigh in determining whether, contrary to the story told by Caler, his alcoholic breath was caused by something stronger than three brandied peaches. In any event, and regardless of the purpose for which the testimony was offered, it is doubtless the law that in an action such as this, to recover damages based on alleged negligence, a plaintiff is allowed to prove and the jury should consider all of the circumstances present at the time of the happening of the accident (Craig v. Boyes, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></span> [11 PaCal.2d 673]), which here would include the condition of both occupants of the car that caused it.</p>\n<p> Appellants next complain of the giving and refusal to give numerous instructions; but we find nothing in the points so made which calls for reversal. [4] The first two instructions challenged used the words \"proximately contributed\" instead of \"proximately caused\". It appears, however, that the term \"proximate cause\" was clearly defined in other instructions and the jury fully advised as to the law relating thereto; consequently no error is shown. (Miner v. Dabney-Johnson Oil Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></span> [28 PaCal.2d 23].) [5] Objection is made also to two instructions upon the ground that they were \"formula\" in character and omitted any reference to the defense of contributory negligence. We are satisfied that the omission complained of was not prejudicial. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*349</span> As held in substance in Brower v. Arnstein, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></span> [14 PaCal.2d 863], in a situation quite similar to the one here presented, where said so-called formula instructions, when separated from each other and from the general charge, omit some elements involved in the case, but the very method of the giving thereof indicates plainly that they were never intended and do not purport to state all of the several elements involved in the case as such in detail, but instead those omitted are made the subject of separate, specific instructions, the giving of such so-called formula instructions does not constitute prejudicial error. And in the present case, as will be seen from reading the entire charge of the court, the two instructions complained of were never intended as formula instructions. Each related to a single, distinct element; and neither purported to embody all of the necessary elements involved in the case. The subject of contributory negligence was specifically treated in other instructions, wherein the law relating thereto was completely and correctly stated; therefore it does not appear possible that the jury could have been misled by the two criticized. (Douglas v. Southern Pac. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></span> [264 P. 237].) [6] Moreover, appellants failed to prove any substantial facts which would justify an inference of contributory negligence; and that being so, there can be no foundation for the claim of prejudicial error with respect to instructions bearing upon that subject. [7] Nor was there any error committed in giving the instruction regarding the application of the brakes of Caler's car, or the refusal to give those relating to statutory speed, because neither of those factors was made a material issue in the case. In any event, in view of the admitted fact that Caler lost control of his car and crashed into respondent's car on the other side of the highway, and the jury's apparent rejection of the explanation offered by him for his actions, it would seem obvious that none of the assignments of error regarding any of the instructions become important and in no event constitute ground for reversal.</p>\n<p> [8] The next point urged relates to the question of special damages.

Horton for Appellant Smith et al., and for Respondent Montgomery.</p>\n<p> Griffin, J.</p>\n<p> The above-numbered actions were consolidated on appeal. One action, commenced July 1, 1932, was an ordinary action upon a promissory note and to foreclose a crop mortgage dated July 19, 1929, executed by Leslie Smith, mortgagor, to John J. Elmore, mortgagee, which mortgage was given as security for its payment upon all crops to be grown upon certain premises in Imperial County during the term of a certain lease held by the mortgagor from David N. Barry and George Diddock.</p>\n<p> Plaintiff sought a restraining order and applied for the appointment of a receiver. Leslie Smith and Grace Smith, by way of answer, alleged the execution of some independent written agreement between John J. Elmore and Leslie Smith which they claimed was unfulfilled and repudiated and that by virtue thereof the mortgage \"has been abandoned by the said John J. Elmore\". T. N. Montgomery set up in a cross-complaint a request for an accounting and also alleged that he did on October 9, 1931, accept from Grace Smith and Leslie Smith two chattel mortgages (duly recorded, but recorded subsequent to the execution and recordation of the Elmore mortgage), upon certain crops to be grown on the same premises, believing that John J. Elmore and his assignee, Elmore Jameson Company, a corporation, had abandoned and repudiated its mortgage and alleged that Elmore Jameson Company, a corporation, assignee, was now estopped from asserting its chattel mortgage lien and claimed that his chattel mortgage was first and a superior lien upon the security. There was also an action in replevin filed by Elmore Jameson Company, a corporation, as assignee, to recover possession of the barley crop which had in the meantime been harvested by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*612</span> T. N. Montgomery, mortgagee, in the subsequent chattel mortgages.</p>\n<p> In this second action the same general defense was interposed with the additional allegation of the defendant Montgomery that he had a claim or lien for services in the harvesting of the crop.</p>\n<p> The application for the appointment of a receiver was denied by the court but on the first day of July, 1932, the court issued a temporary restraining order to defendants, restraining them from \"removing any of said crop of barley ... or from doing anything therewith that will in anywise affect the lien of plaintiff's mortgage herein\". This restraining order was dissolved July 8, 1932. On July 9, 1932, the present action in replevin was filed and after giving security in the form of a bond in the sum of $3,000, plaintiff took the crop and sold it, as it claims under the terms of the mortgage, at a price higher than the then prevailing market price. Plaintiff also left on the premises sufficient barley to pay all rental charges. The crop sold for $1621.32, which sum was held by the plaintiff. These actions were consolidated for the purpose of trial.</p>\n<p> The trial court found that Elmore Jameson Company, a corporation, as assignee, had a crop mortgage upon all of the crops involved in the action and that it was a first and superior lien thereon and prior to the lien of the second mortgages held by Montgomery. The court also sanctioned the sale of the grain made by the Elmore Jameson Company, a corporation, and rendered judgment that it pay to Montgomery $756.08, which represented three-fourths of the reasonable value of his services in harvesting the crop and the reasonable value of the sacks which Montgomery furnished for that purpose. The balance, or one-fourth of the cost, was held to be a charge against the lessee, Leslie Smith. It also held that plaintiff was entitled to all of the proceeds of the sale of the crop, except the amount found due Montgomery as his harvesting and threshing charges set forth, and entered judgment accordingly. Defendants appealed from the judgment rendered in the consolidated actions, excepting that portion of the judgment in favor of T. N. Montgomery. Plaintiff appealed only from that part of the judgment awarding T. N. Montgomery $756.08. The separate appeals are before us solely on the judgment roll alone. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*613</span></p>\n<p> Defendants contend that under section 2910 of the Civil Code the plaintiff's lien under its mortgage was lost or destroyed by its action in replevying the barley and then selling it without complying with section 2967 of the Civil Code, and while the barley was in its possession under the levy; that this was tantamount to a conversion and accordingly the mortgage lien was extinguished (citing Steele v. Marborough Hall Corp., 100 Cal.App. 491, 494 [280 P. 380]; Bailey v. Security Trust Co., 34 Cal.App. 348, 354 [167 P. 409]; Nelson v. Yonge, 73 Cal.App. 704, 710 [239 P. 67]).</p>\n<p> It is further contended that plaintiff's lien was also lost because the sale was illegal, not being made after notice, as required by sections 2967, 3000, 3001, 3002, and 3005, Civil Code, citing Metheny v. Davis, 107 Cal.App. 137 [290 P. 91]; Blodgett v. Rheinschild, 56 Cal.App. 728, 738 [206 P. 674]; and that plaintiff's lien having been extinguished, defendant Montgomery was entitled to the entire value of the grain crop at the time of trial to satisfy his mortgage and \"threshing lien\".</p>\n<p> John J. Elmore, in his agreement with defendant Smith, the grower, agreed to pay all harvesting and threshing charges and furnish necessary equipment therefor. Also, sufficient crops were to be released from the mortgage to pay the rental charges on the leased premises.</p>\n<p> [1] It must be conceded that a power of sale may be given in a chattel mortgage. (Sec. 2932, Civ. Code; Sherlock v. Alturas State Bank, 73 Cal.App. 391 [238 P. 816]; Peet v. People's Trust &amp; Sav. Bank, 56 Cal.App. 46 [204 P. 413].) It is also settled that where a chattel mortgage by its terms gives to the mortgagee the right to take possession of the mortgaged property, upon default in payment, the prior election by the mortgagee to foreclose the mortgage does not bar an action of replevin by the mortgagee to recover possession of the property. Such remedy is ancillary and auxiliary to the foreclosure, resting upon the right of possession given by the contract. (Ely v. Williams, 6 Cal.App. 455 [92 P. 393]; Flinn v. Ferry, 127 Cal. 648, 652 [60 P. 434].)</p>\n<p> [2] We are mindful of the provisions of section 2967 of the Civil Code which provides that \"A mortgagee of personal property, when the debt to secure which the mortgage was executed becomes due, may foreclose the mortgagor's right of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*614</span> redemption by a sale of the property, made in the manner and upon the notice prescribed by the title on 'pledge', or by proceedings under the Code of Civil Procedure,\" and of the general rule that a power of sale, if given in a chattel mortgage or independent instrument, must be exercised in accordance with the provisions thereof and in the manner provided by law, and if not so exercised the sale is void, and results in the extinguishment of the mortgage lien. (Henderson v. Fisher, 38 Cal.App. 270 [176 P. 63]; Helmick v. Holaday, 106 Cal.App. 380, 386 [289 P. 224]; Sherlock v. Alturas State Bank, supra, at p. 398; Blodgett v. Rheinschild, supra, p. 738.)</p>\n<p> [3] The pertinent portions of the contemporaneous agreement authorizing possession and sale of the crop are as follows: \"When said crops mature, the party of the first part (Elmore) agrees to harvest and thresh the same and to bear and pay all expenses in connection therewith and furnish the necessary equipment therefor. ... It is further understood and agreed that as each season's crops are harvested there shall be paid the rental due on said premises therefrom and commissions due for obtaining leases, the balance then remaining shall then be divided between the parties hereto; provided, however, that the party of the first part shall have the right to retain from said second party's share a sufficient amount to reimburse him in full for all moneys then owing him by the party of the first part with interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum. ... It is understood and agreed that the portion of the barley set apart to the party of the first part shall constitute full payment to him of services rendered in the threshing and hauling of said crop ... the party of the first part ... agrees that in the event of said party of the second part failing to comply with the terms hereof to be by him performed, said party (Elmore) may enter upon said premises and take full and complete possession and control thereof and farm the same.\" The chattel mortgage dated July 19, 1929, provides that the said mortgagee (Elmore) is to thresh and deliver said barley and sell the same in accordance with the agreement dated October 15, 1928, and \"as said crops mature, the mortgagor agrees to deliver possession of the same to the mortgagee for the purpose of said mortgagee harvesting, threshing and making division thereof in accordance with the terms of said contract hereinbefore mentioned. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*615</span> The mortgagor further agrees that in the event of his failure to perform any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this mortgage or of said contract, the mortgagee may take immediate possession of said crops and the premises upon which the same are growing and take the necessary steps for the caring for and growing of the same until the same have matured and then gather and harvest the same and from the share thereof to be paid to the mortgagor under the terms of said contract, deduct and withhold therefrom sufficient thereof to pay all costs of the caring for and growing of said barley, as well as any other moneys owing by the mortgagor to the mortgagee, and any and all obligations, ...\"</p>\n<p> The only finding of the trial court respecting the manner of sale of the barley by plaintiff under the chattel mortgage and agreement called to our attention was: \"After giving security in the form of a bond in the sum of Three thousand dollars ($3000) plaintiff Elmore Jameson Company, took said crop and sold the same at a price higher than the then prevailing market price. That plaintiff Elmore Jameson Company left on said premises sufficient barley to pay all rental charges on said premises. That the remainder of the crop sold by plaintiff consisted of 2864 sacks of barley which plaintiff sold for the total sum of One thousand six hundred thirty one dollars and twenty-two cents ($1,631.22) which sum is now held by plaintiff.\"</p>\n<p> We also find this conclusion set forth in paragraph VIII of the findings: \"That by virtue of the terms of plaintiff's mortgage and contract, said default of the defendant Leslie Smith entitled and authorized plaintiff Elmore Jameson Company to enter upon the premises upon which the crops covered by plaintiff's mortgage were growing and to care for, harvest and dispose of said crops at private sale. ...\" It does appear from the record, however, that appellant requested that findings be made as to the actual facts shown by the evidence relative to the taking and manner of selling the property in question. However, no further or additional findings were made. [4] The rule is well established in California that matters which are not part of the judgment roll cannot be considered on appeal unless they are embodied in some other appropriate record. (Brown v. Canty, 31 Cal.App. 183 [159 P. 1056].) When an appeal from a judgment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*616</span> is heard upon the judgment roll alone, all intendments will be made in support of the judgment, and all proceedings necessary to its validity will be presumed to have been regularly taken. If error relied on to destroy such presumptions consists of matters dehors the record, such matters must be brought to the attention of the appellate court by bill of exceptions or other appropriate methods. (Caruthers v. Hensley, 90 Cal. 559 [27 P. 411].) It must be presumed in the instant case that all proceedings necessary to the validity of the sale were regularly taken. We are not disposed to hold, therefore, that the taking of the property in the replevin suit and its subsequent sale under the authority of the chattel mortgage and agreement amounted to a conversion. The authorities cited by appellants are clearly distinguishable and not applicable to the facts in the instant case.</p>\n<p> [5] In considering the merits of plaintiff's appeal from that portion of the judgment allowing defendant Montgomery's claim or lien for expenses in harvesting the crop, it will be observed that it was clearly the obligation of plaintiff under the chattel mortgage and agreement to \"harvest and thresh the same and to bear and pay ALL expenses in connection therewith ... and furnish the necessary equipment therefor\".</p>\n<p> It now appears that under the conflicting claim of right, Montgomery harvested, threshed and paid all expenses in connection with the crop, which inured entirely to the advantage of plaintiff. Plaintiff now contends that the court should not permit defendant Montgomery to acquire a lien or be reimbursed for this expenditure when the act of harvesting was carried on while the restraining order precluding the imposing of any lien on the crop was in effect, and that Montgomery's failure to claim his lien when the property was taken by the plaintiff under the replevin action operated as a waiver thereof. (Citing Civ. Code, sec. 2913; 16 Cal.Jur., p. 331.)</p>\n<p> [6] A mortgage foreclosure and an action for an accounting are equitable proceedings. Under the chattel mortgages of both plaintiff and defendant, Smith, the owner of the crop, was the one, by virtue of the instruments executed, who occasioned the disputed rights of all the parties, and thereby caused Montgomery to make the expenditures to preserve the crop and do the threshing, and all this inured directly to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*617</span> benefit of the chattel mortgagee, John J. Elmore, and saved him, the chattel mortgagee, that amount of money.</p>\n<p> The trial court, notwithstanding the restraining order which was dissolved, imposed a charge of some character for this service, upon the proceeds of the sale of the property. That court acted within its equitable jurisdiction in holding that such a charge should be imposed and properly ordered it paid from the sum remaining in the hands of the plaintiff. (McColgan v. Bank of California Assn., 208 Cal. 329, 337 [281 P. 381, 65 A.L.R. 1075]; Pomeroy's Eq. Jur., vol. 3, 4th ed., sec. 1235, p. 2962; Clatworthy v. Ferguson, 72 Colo. 259 [210 P. 693]; Tulare County v. City of Dinuba, 205 Cal. 111 [270 P. 201]; Mace v. Cole, 50 N. D. 866 [198 N.W. 816, 35 A.L.R. 445].)</p>\n<p> [7] The court allowed defendant Montgomery a recovery of $157.58, as being the value of the sacks furnished and only $598.50, or three-fourths of the cost of harvesting, holding that the remaining one-fourth was chargeable to the defendant Leslie Smith, being the cost of the harvesting of the rental share of the barley. If the defendant Montgomery was entitled to any reimbursement for the harvesting and furnishing of necessary sacks, it appears to us that under the terms of the agreement and chattel mortgage, Montgomery was entitled to recover from plaintiff the full amount expended for that purpose because the contract provided: \"party of the first part (Elmore) agrees to harvest and thresh the same and to bear and pay all expenses in connection therewith\", that is, $798 for harvesting and $157.58 costs of sacks, totaling $955.58. The balance due or the amount of the deficiency judgment in favor of plaintiff and against the defendant Leslie Smith should also be increased accordingly.</p>\n<p> The judgment of the trial court is reversed with instructions to enter judgment in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p> Marks, Acting P.

The authorities cited by appellants are clearly distinguishable and not applicable to the facts in the instant case.</p>\n<p> [5] In considering the merits of plaintiff's appeal from that portion of the judgment allowing defendant Montgomery's claim or lien for expenses in harvesting the crop, it will be observed that it was clearly the obligation of plaintiff under the chattel mortgage and agreement to \"harvest and thresh the same and to bear and pay ALL expenses in connection therewith ... and furnish the necessary equipment therefor\".</p>\n<p> It now appears that under the conflicting claim of right, Montgomery harvested, threshed and paid all expenses in connection with the crop, which inured entirely to the advantage of plaintiff. Plaintiff now contends that the court should not permit defendant Montgomery to acquire a lien or be reimbursed for this expenditure when the act of harvesting was carried on while the restraining order precluding the imposing of any lien on the crop was in effect, and that Montgomery's failure to claim his lien when the property was taken by the plaintiff under the replevin action operated as a waiver thereof. (Citing Civ. Code, sec. 2913; 16 Cal.Jur., p. 331.)</p>\n<p> [6] A mortgage foreclosure and an action for an accounting are equitable proceedings. Under the chattel mortgages of both plaintiff and defendant, Smith, the owner of the crop, was the one, by virtue of the instruments executed, who occasioned the disputed rights of all the parties, and thereby caused Montgomery to make the expenditures to preserve the crop and do the threshing, and all this inured directly to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*617</span> benefit of the chattel mortgagee, John J. Elmore, and saved him, the chattel mortgagee, that amount of money.</p>\n<p> The trial court, notwithstanding the restraining order which was dissolved, imposed a charge of some character for this service, upon the proceeds of the sale of the property. That court acted within its equitable jurisdiction in holding that such a charge should be imposed and properly ordered it paid from the sum remaining in the hands of the plaintiff. (McColgan v.

If the defendant Montgomery was entitled to any reimbursement for the harvesting and furnishing of necessary sacks, it appears to us that under the terms of the agreement and chattel mortgage, Montgomery was entitled to recover from plaintiff the full amount expended for that purpose because the contract provided: \"party of the first part (Elmore) agrees to harvest and thresh the same and to bear and pay all expenses in connection therewith\", that is, $798 for harvesting and $157.58 costs of sacks, totaling $955.58. The balance due or the amount of the deficiency judgment in favor of plaintiff and against the defendant Leslie Smith should also be increased accordingly.</p>\n<p> The judgment of the trial court is reversed with instructions to enter judgment in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p> Marks, Acting P.

J.</p>\n<p> Appellant was charged in an information with the crime of murder committed on or about September 29, 1938, and pleaded \"not guilty\" to the charge. Thereafter the jury returned a verdict finding appellant guilty of the crime of manslaughter, a lesser offense than that charged in the information but necessarily included therein. This appeal is prosecuted from the judgment of conviction, as well as from the order by which appellant's motion for a new trial was denied.</p>\n<p> On the evening of September 29, 1938, William Yates and his wife, together with two other men and one woman, called at the home of appellant. Accompanied by appellant and his wife, the party, all colored, went to the Elks Cocktail Lounge on Central Avenue in the city of Los Angeles, where they all had drinks and danced, returning later to appellant's apartment, where more drinks were served. About midnight the party broke up and everyone went out to the Yates' car which was parked in front of appellant's house. Mrs. Yates got in the front seat beside her husband who was sitting behind the steering wheel, and the other woman and the two men got into the rear. Lottie Jefferson, appellant's wife, insisted on getting into the front seat next to Mrs. Yates, and asked to be taken to Central Avenue. Appellant objected to this, but Mr. Yates assured him he would not take Mrs. Jefferson any place, whereupon appellant got into his car and drove away. Mr. and Mrs. Yates then tried to persuade Mrs. Jefferson to get out of their car so that they could leave, and finally she did get out of the car but immediately walked around to the other side and took hold of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*280</span> steering wheel refusing to let go. The evidence becomes somewhat confused at this point, but it appears from the record that appellant at this time returned to the scene and, according to his own testimony, he found Mr. Yates hitting Mrs. Jefferson, who was sitting on Mrs. Yates and attempting to choke her. With regard to this affray, appellant testified upon cross-examination as follows:</p>\n<p> \"When I got up and saw that it was my wife that Mr. Yates was hitting, I walked up there and jerked him back and throwed him up against his car and picked my wife up, and I walked up to him and asked him what did he mean by hitting my wife like that. ... Q. Then what happened? A. Well, when I asked of Mr. Yates what did he mean by hitting my wife like that, he put his hand in his pocket and come out with a knife and started toward me cussing. ... I kept backing, I backed away from him and told him not to come up on me. ... And he kept coming and cussing and I just kept begging him not to come up on me and I stopped and fired a shot to scare him. Q. You fired that shot up in the air, is that what you mean? Is that right? A. Yes, that is right. Q. And then what happened? A. He kept coming on me and I kept hollering not to come on me and I backed up against the side to the wall and fell in a hole and then I fired a shot at him. Q. When you fired that second shot you meant to shoot to kill him. A. I meant to hit him.\"</p>\n<p> After the shooting, Mr. Yates walked to the automobile where he was placed on the back seat and taken to a hospital. He died on October 2, 1938, as a result of injuries he sustained when he was shot by appellant.</p>\n<p> Appellant admitted the killing, but relied upon his plea of self-defense in justification of his conduct, contending upon this appeal that \"the sole issuable fact is whether the acts and conduct of the deceased were sufficient to excite in the defendant a reasonable fear that the deceased intended and would do defendant some great bodily injury\".</p>\n<p> For a reversal of the judgment of conviction, appellant relies upon the following points:</p>\n<p> \"1. That the verdict is contrary to the evidence.\"</p>\n<p> \"2. The exclusion of testimony respecting the knowledge of defendant of a particular act of violence of the deceased and defendant's state of mind because of said knowledge. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*281</span>\"</p>\n<p> \"3. Failure to accord the defendant an opportunity to present newly discovered evidence respecting the actual character of the deceased.\"</p>\n<p> \"4. Failure of the court to give certain instructions requested by the defendant.\"</p>\n<p> \"5. The giving of three instructions not applicable to the facts of the case or misleading to the jury, to wit: An instruction on flight, instruction on dying declaration, and instruction with respect to the plea of self-defense and when it was not available.\"</p>\n<p> \"6. The admission of testimony of respecting the so-called declaration.\"</p>\n<p> In connection with his second point, appellant urges that the court erred in sustaining an objection to his offer to prove that he knew that \"on April 25th, in the year 1937, the decedent William Yates assaulted one Howard Morris with a knife, necessitating some 40 stitches, otherwise carved this Howard Morris; that as a result of this affray, Mr. William Yates served some time in the County Jail, and it was at that time that Mr. Jefferson first became acquainted with Mr. Yates, and it was with this knowledge of this tendency on the part of Mr. Yates to resort to the use of a knife in physical combat that made him (appellant) act as he did on the evening of September 29, 1938\".</p>\n<p> Appellant testified that decedent's reputation for peace and quiet was bad. To the question asked of appellant, \"Did you have any reason to feel that Mr. Yates might cut you with that knife?\" the prosecution objected \"unless it is confined to this particular occasion when the shooting occurred or some threat communicated by some manner and means, some threat by Yates toward the life or safety of this individual. My point is that there is an exception to the hearsay rule and it is confined to general reputation or threats by the decedent or assailant toward the witness or defendant. The Court: Well, I think it can go a little beyond that. It seems to me that you put something in that question that won't get by. The objection is sustained to that particular question. Q. By Mr. Fueller: On this evening, had you any knowledge of any act previously done by Mr. Yates which caused you to fear that he might cut you with that knife? Mr. Leavy: I object to that, if the Court please, unless it was an act done toward the defendant at some past time by the decedent, or else some threat made by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*282</span> the decedent toward this defendant and communicated by some manner or means. ... The Court: The objection is overruled to that question, answer yes or no. A. Yes. Q. By Mr. Fueller: What was that knowledge? Mr. Leavy: I object to that as incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial. ... The court: Objection sustained to that. Mr. Blanche: May we ask at this time, if the Court please, does the Court feel that any light that he might throw on what knowledge that he had would be irrelevant? The Court: I don't know that it is necessary to follow it any further, unless the district attorney wants to find out what he bases it on. Mr. Blanche: May we make our offer of proof at this time then? The Court: Is it the same offer that you made before? Mr. Blanche: The offer as to the particular act which we discussed. The Court: Do you object to it? Mr. Leavy: I didn't hear your inquiry. The Court: He just wants to make an offer of proof substantially the same as was made. Mr. Leavy: I will stipulate that they are making the same offer of proof as was made before. Mr. Blanche: We are willing to confine our offer of proof in accordance with the Court's suggestion. The Court: And you are objecting to that? Mr. Leavy: We object to this last question on the ground that I objected and for the reasons before that I gave. The Court: The objection is sustained.\"</p>\n<p> [1] \"While the general rule is that the reputation of deceased cannot be given in evidence, an exception arises where the plea of self-defense is interposed and the evidence leaves it in doubt whether the deceased was the aggressor, or where the circumstances attending the homicide render it doubtful whether the defendant was justified in believing himself in imminent danger at the hands of deceased. (People v. Lamar, 148 Cal. 564 [83 P. 993]; People v. Powell, 87 Cal. 348 [25 P. 481, 11 L.R.A. 75].) [2] Evidence of the reputation of deceased, unknown to the defendant at the time of the homicide, must be limited to the question as to who was the assailant, but on the other hand, where such reputation was known to defendant, evidence thereof is admissible, not only to determine the aggressor but also as bearing on the question whether defendant was justified in believing himself in imminent danger--whether his knowledge of the reputation of deceased, taken into consideration with all the other circumstances, was sufficient to excite the fears of a reasonable man. (People v. Lamar, 148 Cal. 564 [83 P. 993]; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*283</span> People v. Howard, 112 Cal. 135 [44 P. 464]; People v. Powell, 87 Cal. 348 [25 P. 481, 11 L.R.A. 75]; People v. Singh, 78 Cal.App. 488 [248 P. 986].) [3] Such evidence should be confined to the traits of character which are in issue, and should bear some analogy and reference to the nature of the charge. (People v. Cord, 157 Cal. 562 [108 P. 511]; People v. Barrett, 22 Cal.App. 780 [136 P. 520]; People v. Haydon, 18 Cal.App. 543 [123 P. 1102].) The reputation of deceased for peace and quiet is involved. ... But it has been held that evidence is not admissible to show that deceased has been convicted of simple assault upon another. (People v. Griner, 124 Cal. 19 [56 P. 625]).\" (13 Cal.Jur., p. 693.) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p> In the case of People v. Hoffman, 195 Cal. 295, at 310 [232 P. 974], it is stated: \"Where the only question to be determined is the existence and reasonableness of the belief under which the deceased claims to have acted in self-defense, evidence of the bad reputation of the deceased, or of one whom the defendant supposed to be his assailant, is wholly immaterial and inadmissible unless the defendant first shows that he had knowledge of such reputation. (State v. Kennade, 121 Mo. 405 [26 S.W. 347]; State v. Rollins, 113 N. C. 722 [18 S.E. 394]; Commonwealth v. Straesser, 153 Pa. St. 451 [26 Atl. 17]; State v. Blassengame, 132 La. 250 [61 So. 219].) ... Moreover, there is respectable authority for the proposition that the reputation for peace and quiet of the decedent, or of one whom the defendant supposed to be his assailant, is not alone sufficient where the issue is self-defense, but must be coupled with that person's reputation as a violent, turbulent and bloodthirsty man. (Tribble v. State, 145 Ala. 23 [40 So. 938]; King v. State, 17 Ala. App. 381 [85 So. 876].)\"</p>\n<p> Also, in the case of People v. Singh, 78 Cal.App. 488, at 496 [248 P. 986], it was held that it was error to reject evidence offered by the defendant that the deceased was in the habit of carrying a gun, with which he had on prior occasions threatened others, and that these facts were known to the defendant, the court there stating: \"Assuming that the evidence already before the court tended to show that immediately before the shooting occurred Hager had 'jumped at, or toward, or on' defendant, with knowledge in defendant that Hager was probably armed and that therefore with a 'gun' he had threatened other persons, the serious and legally <span class=\"star-pagination\">*284</span> pertinent question would arise as to whether in such circumstances, as a reasonable man, defendant would be justified in believing that either his life was in danger or that great bodily harm would result to him by reason of conditions then and there existing. It is clear that so considered the offered evidence was admissible and that defendant was substantially prejudiced by reason of the refusal of the trial court to permit such evidence to be introduced.\"</p>\n<p> [4] Several witnesses testified that they heard appellant tell the deceased, \"Don't come up to me,\" or \"Don't come back,\" or \"Don't come upon me\"; and \"If you come upon me I will shoot, I will shoot you,\" and also that Mr. Jefferson (appellant) was backing and Mr. Yates (decedent) was walking toward him.</p>\n<p> In the circumstances presented by the record herein and upon the authority of the cases hereinbefore cited, it was prejudicial error to exclude testimony respecting appellant's knowledge, acquired prior to the time he fired the two shots, with regard to decedent's proclivity to resort to the use of a knife while engaged in physical combat.</p>\n<p> Because of the conclusion reached by this court upon the question hereinbefore discussed, it is not deemed necessary to pass upon the other points raised by appellant.</p>\n<p> The judgment and the order denying appellant's motion for a new trial are, and each of them is, reversed.</p>\n<p> Doran, J., and White, J., concurred.</p>\n</div>","html_columbia":null,"html_with_citations":"<div>\n<center><b><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

J.</p>\n<p> This is an appeal from the judgment and decree of the superior court establishing heirship in a proceeding under section 1080 of the Probate Code in the estate of Frank Paterson. The court found the only surviving heirs at law and next of kin of Paterson to be Rosina Luise Loder nee Dick, Marie Elise Pauli nee Dick, and Rosina Ponte nee Dick. These respondents are admittedly related to Paterson on his mother's side in the fifth degree. The appellants, Norman N. Blakely, Samuel Blakely and Margaret Daly, are admittedly related to Paterson on his father's side in the eighth degree. The trial court found against another claimant--one Fritz Weyeneth-Marolf--and he has not appealed. It is the theory of appellants that, although they are admittedly further removed in relationship from the decedent than are respondents, they are Paterson's lawful next of kin for the reason that respondents are descendants of an illegitimate grandmother, Anna Maria Weyeneth. It <span class=\"star-pagination\">*307</span> is contended that an illegitimate ancestor cannot act as a conduit for purposes of inheritance under the laws of this state.</p>\n<p> The trial court, in dealing with the claims of respondents and appellants, made no express finding as to the legitimacy of Paterson's grandmother. It simply found that \"Frank Paterson left him surviving as his only heirs of law\" the respondents; \"that the relationship of each of said three last-mentioned claimants to said deceased is in the fifth degree.\" As to appellants, the court found that their relationship \"to said deceased, if any, is that of second cousin once removed, and is a relationship in the eighth degree.\"</p>\n<p> Respondents first contend that the evidence as to the legitimacy of Anna Maria was conflicting, and that, therefore, the finding as to relationship is amply supported on the theory that she was legitimate. An examination of the record indicates that upon the trial the great mass of the evidence introduced by both appellants and respondents on the issue of kinship was hearsay, and that all the evidence relating to the legitimacy of Anna Maria Weyeneth was hearsay. All of this testimony was admitted without objection and by stipulation of the parties. There are several affidavits which contain general language which indicates that Anna Maria Weyeneth was the legitimate daughter of Elizabeth Suter. The evidence to the contrary, however, is practically overwhelming. Moreover, the record shows that the cause was tried on the theory that Anna Maria Weyeneth was illegitimate. The record also shows that in the trial court's order determining heirship, in denying the claims of Fritz Weyeneth the court stated:</p>\n<p> \"The petition of Fritz Weyeneth is denied upon the ground that the evidence is legally insufficient to establish that his ancestor Anna Maria Weyeneth was legitimated by the several acts of her father relied on by said petitioner. ...\"</p>\n<p> Under such circumstances it must be held that Anna Maria Weyeneth was found by the trial court to be illegitimate, and that respondents may recover, if at all, only upon the theory that an illegitimate ancestor may act as a conduit for purposes of inheritance.</p>\n<p> [1] The right of inheritance being statutory, the solution of this problem is obviously one of construction. The pertinent statutory provisions are as follows:</p>\n<p> Section 226 of the Probate Code provides in part: <span class=\"star-pagination\">*308</span> \"If the decedent leaves neither issue, spouse, parent, brother, sister, nor descendant of a deceased brother or sister, the estate goes to the next of kin in equal degree, ...\"</p>\n<p> Section 255 of the Probate Code provides:</p>\n<p> \"Every illegitimate child is an heir of his mother, and also of the person who, in writing, signed in the presence of a competent witness, acknowledges himself to be the father; and inherits his or her estate, in whole or in part, as the case may be, in the same manner as if he had been born in lawful wedlock; but he does not represent his father or mother by inheriting any part of the estate of the parent's kindred, either lineal or collateral, unless, before his death, his parents shall have intermarried, and his father, after such marriage, acknowledges him as his child, or adopts him into his family; in which case such child is deemed legitimate for all purposes of succession.\"</p>\n<p> Section 256 of the Probate Code provides:</p>\n<p> \"The estate of an illegitimate child, who, having title to any estate not otherwise limited by marriage contract, dies without disposing thereof by will, is succeeded to as if he had been born in lawful wedlock, if he has been legitimated by a subsequent marriage of his parents or adopted by his father as provided by the Civil Code; otherwise, it is succeeded to as if he had been born in lawful wedlock and had survived his father and all persons related to him only through his father.\"</p>\n<p> For convenience in considering the claims of respondents the following diagram graphically illustrates the problem involved:1</p>\n<p> Graphic Material Omitted</p>\n<p> If the inheritable line can properly ascend through Anna Maria Weyeneth to Elizabeth Suter, and through her to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*309</span> respondents, it is obvious that respondents are related to decedent Paterson in the fifth degree under the provisions of section 251 of the Probate Code.</p>\n<p> [2] It is the contention of appellants that at common law an illegitimate child had no inheritable blood so far as his ancestors were concerned. This was undoubtedly true. The applicable principle has been stated by Blackstone, Cooley's fourth edition, volume 1, page 633, as follows:</p>\n<p> \"Bastards are incapable of being heirs. Bastards, by our law, are such children as are not born either in lawful wedlock, or within a competent time after its determination. Such are held to be nullius filii, the sons of nobody; for the maxim of law is, qui ex damnato coitu nascuntur, inter liberos non computantur (those who are the offspring of an illicit connexion are not reckoned as children). Being thus the sons of nobody, they have no blood in them, at least no inheritable blood; consequently, none of the blood of the first purchaser; and therefore, if there be no other claimant than such illegitimate children, the land shall escheat to the lord.\"</p>\n<p> And again at page 634 it is stated:</p>\n<p> \"As bastards cannot be heirs themselves, so neither can they have any heirs but those of their own bodies. For as all collateral kindred consists in being derived from the same common ancestor, and as a bastard has no legal ancestors, he can have no collateral kindred; and, consequently, can have no legal heirs, but such as claim by a lineal descent from himself.\"</p>\n<p> The rationale of this doctrine is clear. At common law illegitimates are the sons of nobody. They have no inheritable blood in them. They cannot be heirs, nor can they have heirs save those of their own body. Since an illegitimate can have no legal ancestors, he could, of course, have no collateral kindred.</p>\n<p> In this state the common law is applicable unless changed by statute (sec. 4468, Pol. Code), so that the sole question presented is whether the above common law rules have been changed by the above-quoted statutes. An examination of sections 255 and 256 of the Probate Code, supra, demonstrates that these statutes of succession, generally speaking, with respect to the maternal line, have bestowed upon an illegitimate child the same inheritable blood as have legitimate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*310</span> offspring, and, subject to the limitations therein contained, provide that such illegitimates may inherit and transmit property in the same manner as legitimates. To illustrate: The opening clause of section 255 makes the illegitimate the heir of his mother--thus repudiating the common law rule to the contrary. The last clause of section 256 provides that the illegitimate is endowed with inheritable blood precisely the same as that of a legitimate child, insofar as the devolution of his estate to his mother and through her to collateral kindred is concerned. This section provides, in effect, that as to all relationships except those arising from his father, the illegitimate's property is to be inherited as if he were legitimate. The doctrine of the common law that he has no inheritable blood has thus been abolished in this respect. That these sections have entirely changed the common law rules relating to the capacity of illegitimates to inherit and to transmit inheritance was expressly held in Estate of Wardell, 57 Cal. 484. In that case a testatrix died leaving surviving two legitimate sons, mentioned in the will, and an illegitimate daughter not mentioned in the will. The question presented was whether such illegitimate child was a pretermitted heir under the terms of section 1307 of the Civil Code (now substantially embodied in sec. 90 of the Probate Code). That section provided that \"when any testator omits to provide in his will for any of his children ... unless it appears that such omission was intentional, such child ... must have the same share of the estate of the testator as if he had died intestate. ...\" The contention was made that the terms \"children\" and \"child\" as used in this statute included only legitimate children, on the ground that at common law such terms referred only to legitimate children. The court, while conceding this to be true at common law, pointed out that illegitimates under the laws of this and other states have been made (p. 491) \"capable of inheriting and transmitting inheritance\". After referring to section 1387 of the Civil Code from which section 255 of the Probate Code was substantially copied, the court pointed out (p. 491) that: \"the State has regulated the inheritable capacity of all children illegitimate by birth\". In holding that an illegitimate was a child within the meaning of Civil Code section 1307 the court stated (p. 492): <span class=\"star-pagination\">*311</span></p>\n<p> \"The respondent was, therefore, though illegitimate by birth, endowed by the statute with inheritable blood. She possessed the same heritable rights as heir of her mother, as if born in lawful wedlock. (Rogers v. Weller, 5 Biss. 166 [Fed. Cas. No. 12,022]; Garland v. Harrison, 8 Leigh, (35 Va.) 368; Bennett v. Toler, 15 Gratt. (56 Va.) 588 [78 Am. Dec. 638].) As an heir of her mother, she differed nothing in law from the other children, so far as the rights of inheritance which had been conferred upon her by law. To the full extent of those rights she was entitled to all the privileges and immunities of heirship. If her mother had died intestate, her right to a distributive share of the estate would have been unquestionable. Dying testate, the legal relation between mother and daughter was not impaired or destroyed. The latter was still a legitimate heir, as much so as the children legitimate by birth, for the law made her and (sic) heir to the same extent 'as if she had been born in lawful wedlock.'\"</p>\n<p> \"It is not to be supposed that the law which attached to her person the rights and duties of inheritance, and endowed her with the capacity to exercise them, meant to leave her a bastard, under the disabilities of the common law, if the mother unintentionally omitted to make provision for her in her will. When placed by law in the state and condition of heir, and invested with the character and capacity of heir, all the rights, privileges, and legal consequences incident to that relation were tacitly conferred upon her.\"</p>\n<p> The same general reasoning applies here. Section 226 of the Probate Code, above quoted, provides that the property of the decedent here involved must go to his \"next of kin in equal degree.\" Appellants argue that the grandchildren of Elizabeth Suter, by Dick, who is the great grandmother of decedent, are not Paterson's next of kin because Paterson's grandmother, Anna Maria, was illegitimate. Stated another way, it is urged that the phrase \"next of kin\" must be interpreted to mean legitimate next of kin. This contention must be predicated on the theory that an illegitimate has no inheritable blood for the purpose of taking or transmitting property--the reason behind the common law rule already discussed. Under sections 255 and 256 of the Probate Code, supra, that doctrine has been abolished. When the reason for a rule ceases, the rule should <span class=\"star-pagination\">*312</span> cease. (Civ. Code, sec. 3510.) Next of kin simply means those upon whom, under the circumstances defined in section 226 of the Probate Code, the law has conferred the right to inherit the property of one who dies intestate. Under section 256 an illegitimate is endowed, for the purpose of transmission of his property, with the same inheritable blood as that of a legitimate, as therein limited. His own heirs, as therein limited, are the same as those of a legitimate. There can be no doubt that had Anna Maria, the illegitimate grandmother of decedent, been living at his death, and had Paterson left no issue, spouse, parent, brother, sister or descendant of a deceased brother or sister, that Anna Maria would have inherited her grandson's property under section 226. But the inheritable bloodstream does not end with her. Under the provisions of section 256 she, although illegitimate, has been endowed with inheritable blood as if she \"had been born in lawful wedlock\" and had survived her father. Without doubt, the great grandmother of Paterson, the mother of Anna Maria, Elizabeth Suter, would be the heir of Anna Maria. If Anna Maria had been legitimate it is obvious Elizabeth Suter would be the next of kin of Paterson had she survived under the circumstances set forth in section 226. Stated another way, the phrase \"next of kin\" in section 226, just as the term \"children\" in section 90 of the Probate Code, by reason of the provisions of section 256 must be interpreted to include those in the illegitimate line as well as in the legitimate line.</p>\n<p> [3] Appellant urges that section 256 applies only where the estate of an illegitimate is before the court. This contention is without merit. We are here dealing with the interpretation of the phrase \"next of kin\" in section 226. Section 256 is looked to simply to ascertain the degree to which the legislature has conferred inheritable blood on illegitimates. It must be held that by these various sections the legislature has seen fit to unite the family tree of the illegitimate with that of his mother.</p>\n<p> Apparently there is no case in this jurisdiction directly holding that the mother of an illegitimate, or her descendants, are next of kin and may thus inherit from the legitimate descendants of an illegitimate. The principle, however, has been applied in analogous situations. It has been directly held in the Estate of Magee, 63 Cal. 414, that an illegitimate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*313</span> may act as a conduit for purposes of inheritance. This case refutes appellants' theory, and necessarily refutes the strict limited interpretation they seek to place on section 256. In the Magee case, Suez Magee died intestate. She was an illegitimate daughter of Susan Magee, who predeceased her. Susan Magee had another illegitimate daughter, the half sister of the deceased, named Elizabeth Magee, who also predeceased the decedent. Elizabeth left surviving a legitimate son, Albert Redmond. Albert, therefore, if he could properly use his illegitimate mother Elizabeth as a conduit for purposes of inheritance, was related to the decedent in the third degree. It was held that Albert inherited the estate as against the claims of others related to the decedent in the fourth degree entirely through legitimate ancestors. In other words, it was held that under our statutory law, the legitimate child of an illegitimate, through his grandmother and illegitimate mother, could inherit the estate of the illegitimate half sister of his mother. Although it is true that in this case the estate of an illegitimate was before the court, the importance of the case is that it holds that the illegitimate mother of Albert could be used as a conduit through which Albert could inherit. The reasoning by which this conclusion was reached is instructive in the present case. At page 415 it is stated:</p>\n<p> \"According to section 1388, Civil Code, if any illegitimate child (not acknowledged or adopted by his father) dies intestate, without lawful issue, his estate goes to his mother, or, in case of her decease, to her heirs at law. Suez Magee was illegitimate; she died intestate; Susan, her mother, had died before her; therefore, upon the death of Suez, the property of the latter was to go to the heirs of the mother, Susan. The next question, then, is who are the heirs of Susan? Section 1387, Civil Code, we think, answers the inquiry. Every illegitimate child is in all cases an heir of his mother, and inherits in the same manner as if born in lawful wedlock. There is no question as to the heirship of Albert E.; he is the legitimate son of his mother, Elizabeth. She (Elizabeth) was the illegitimate daughter of Susan. By section 1387, just referred to, Elizabeth was the heir of her mother, in the same manner as if born in lawful wedlock. If, then, Elizabeth had been born in lawful wedlock, she would unquestionably have been heir of her mother; being born out of wedlock, she is by the statute made heir of her mother in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*314</span> the same manner as if born in wedlock. Being, then, the heir of her mother, and dying leaving issue, the property of Suez goes to such issue; not because the issue is heir of Suez, but is heir of Susan.\"</p>\n<p> And again at page 416 it is stated:</p>\n<p> \"If Elizabeth had died intestate and without issue, doubtless the estate of Suez would have gone to the Cunninghams, as the heirs of Susan, the mother of Elizabeth and Suez; but as Albert E. is, through his mother, Elizabeth, the heir of Susan, he is entitled to the estate of Suez--not, perhaps, because he is the heir of Suez, but because he is the heir of the mother of Suez, and as such is, under the statute, entitled to take.\"</p>\n<p> Thus Estate of Magee, supra, holds that the son of an illegitimate mother may inherit through that mother the estate of a descendant of his maternal grandmother. That is the converse of the situation presented in the instant case. But the same reasoning applies. If the above premise is sound, and it has been reaffirmed in Estate of De Cigaran, 150 Cal. 682 [89 P. 833], and Estate of Smith, 2 Cal.2d 652 [42 PaCal.2d 1011], it would seem to follow that the estate of a descendant (Paterson) of an illegitimate (Anna Maria) may be inherited by the mother of the illegitimate (Elizabeth Suter) or her descendants (respondents). If the illegitimate can act as a conduit going in one direction it would seem to necessarily follow that she can act as a conduit going in the other direction. Any other conclusion would be extremely illogical. The real question in each situation is whether the common law rule depriving the illegitimate of inheritable blood has been changed in this state, so that an illegitimate can act as a conduit for purposes of inheritance. The Magee case holds that it has. The language in the Magee case concerning the limitation upon the inheritable blood of an illegitimate in section 255 of the Probate Code is not here applicable. There is no such comparable limitation in section 256 with which we are here concerned. If under section 255 as held in the Magee case, the illegitimate may act as a conduit from his mother to his children--if his children may inherit from his mother through him, it follows that by section 256 the illegitimate may act as a conduit from his descendants to his mother. If by section 255 his descendants are permitted to inherit through him from his mother, it must <span class=\"star-pagination\">*315</span> follow that by section 256 his mother may inherit from his descendants because by that section she is made his heir.</p>\n<p> To summarize: Clearly, Anna Maria was entitled to inherit from her legitimate descendants, and as such she, if living, would have been the next of kin of Paterson. This being so, section 256 operates in favor of Anna Maria's mother, Elizabeth Suter, and her descendants--respondents here.</p>\n<p> Appellants rely on three cases as establishing a contrary rule--Curtis v. Hewins, 52 Mass. (11 Metc.) 294, Hardesty v. Mitchell, 302 Ill. 369 [134 N.E. 745, 24 A.L.R. 565], and Sanford v. Marsh, 180 Mass. 210 [62 N.E. 268]. It must be conceded that these three cases interpreted statutes substantially similar to the ones here involved contrary to the interpretation here made. The Curtis case contains little or no discussion. The Hardesty case is predicated on the Sanford case. The underlying reasoning of the Sanford case is disclosed in the following quotation. At page 268 it is stated:</p>\n<p> \"The case before us is not within the language of the statute, for we are not dealing with the estate of an illegitimate child, but with the estate of the daughter of an illegitimate child, who had deceased before the daughter. The question is whether the statute shall be construed strictly, or whether we discover in it a purpose to place all persons claiming through an illegitimate relation in the same position as if there were no illegitimacy in reference to the distribution of the property of persons dying intestate who are descended from an illegitimate ancestor. By the common law a bastard is nullius filius. He can be the heir of no one, nor have heirs, except of his own body. He has no ancestors from whom any inheritable blood can be derived. The common law on this subject is in force in Massachusetts, except as it has been changed by the statutes. The statutes which have been adopted here have all been construed strictly. ... We see no good reason for departing from the rule that statutes of this kind are to be construed strictly.\"</p>\n<p> [4] This is not the rule of construction in this state. Section 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure now reads, and has so read since 1872, that:</p>\n<p> \"The rule of the common law, that statutes in derogation thereof are to be strictly construed, has no application to this code. The code establishes the law of this state respecting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*316</span> the subjects to which it relates, and its provisions and all proceedings under it are to be liberally construed, with a view to effect its objects and to promote justice.\"</p>\n<p> Section 2 of the Probate Code provides:</p>\n<p> \"The provisions of this code, so far as they are substantially the same as existing statutes, must be construed as continuations thereof, and not as new enactments.\"</p>\n<p> In the Magee case section 255 was given such liberal construction. We must give the same liberal construction to section 256. The Magee case is opposed in theory to the above three cases. The rule of the Magee case is followed generally (see Foster v. Lee, 172 Ala. 32 [55 So. 125, Ann. Cas. 1913C, 1335]; Bales v. Elder, 118 Ill. 436 [11 N.E. 421]; McKellar v. Harkins, 183 Iowa, 1030 [166 N.W. 1061]; Sutton v.

The pertinent statutory provisions are as follows:</p>\n<p> Section 226 of the Probate Code provides in part: <span class=\"star-pagination\">*308</span> \"If the decedent leaves neither issue, spouse, parent, brother, sister, nor descendant of a deceased brother or sister, the estate goes to the next of kin in equal degree, ...\"</p>\n<p> Section 255 of the Probate Code provides:</p>\n<p> \"Every illegitimate child is an heir of his mother, and also of the person who, in writing, signed in the presence of a competent witness, acknowledges himself to be the father; and inherits his or her estate, in whole or in part, as the case may be, in the same manner as if he had been born in lawful wedlock; but he does not represent his father or mother by inheriting any part of the estate of the parent's kindred, either lineal or collateral, unless, before his death, his parents shall have intermarried, and his father, after such marriage, acknowledges him as his child, or adopts him into his family; in which case such child is deemed legitimate for all purposes of succession.\"</p>\n<p> Section 256 of the Probate Code provides:</p>\n<p> \"The estate of an illegitimate child, who, having title to any estate not otherwise limited by marriage contract, dies without disposing thereof by will, is succeeded to as if he had been born in lawful wedlock, if he has been legitimated by a subsequent marriage of his parents or adopted by his father as provided by the Civil Code; otherwise, it is succeeded to as if he had been born in lawful wedlock and had survived his father and all persons related to him only through his father.\"</p>\n<p> For convenience in considering the claims of respondents the following diagram graphically illustrates the problem involved:1</p>\n<p> Graphic Material Omitted</p>\n<p> If the inheritable line can properly ascend through Anna Maria Weyeneth to Elizabeth Suter, and through her to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*309</span> respondents, it is obvious that respondents are related to decedent Paterson in the fifth degree under the provisions of section 251 of the Probate Code.</p>\n<p> [2] It is the contention of appellants that at common law an illegitimate child had no inheritable blood so far as his ancestors were concerned. This was undoubtedly true. The applicable principle has been stated by Blackstone, Cooley's fourth edition, volume 1, page 633, as follows:</p>\n<p> \"Bastards are incapable of being heirs. Bastards, by our law, are such children as are not born either in lawful wedlock, or within a competent time after its determination. Such are held to be nullius filii, the sons of nobody; for the maxim of law is, qui ex damnato coitu nascuntur, inter liberos non computantur (those who are the offspring of an illicit connexion are not reckoned as children). Being thus the sons of nobody, they have no blood in them, at least no inheritable blood; consequently, none of the blood of the first purchaser; and therefore, if there be no other claimant than such illegitimate children, the land shall escheat to the lord.\"</p>\n<p> And again at page 634 it is stated:</p>\n<p> \"As bastards cannot be heirs themselves, so neither can they have any heirs but those of their own bodies. For as all collateral kindred consists in being derived from the same common ancestor, and as a bastard has no legal ancestors, he can have no collateral kindred; and, consequently, can have no legal heirs, but such as claim by a lineal descent from himself.\"</p>\n<p> The rationale of this doctrine is clear. At common law illegitimates are the sons of nobody. They have no inheritable blood in them. They cannot be heirs, nor can they have heirs save those of their own body. Since an illegitimate can have no legal ancestors, he could, of course, have no collateral kindred.</p>\n<p> In this state the common law is applicable unless changed by statute (sec. 4468, Pol. Code), so that the sole question presented is whether the above common law rules have been changed by the above-quoted statutes. An examination of sections 255 and 256 of the Probate Code, supra, demonstrates that these statutes of succession, generally speaking, with respect to the maternal line, have bestowed upon an illegitimate child the same inheritable blood as have legitimate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*310</span> offspring, and, subject to the limitations therein contained, provide that such illegitimates may inherit and transmit property in the same manner as legitimates. To illustrate: The opening clause of section 255 makes the illegitimate the heir of his mother--thus repudiating the common law rule to the contrary. The last clause of section 256 provides that the illegitimate is endowed with inheritable blood precisely the same as that of a legitimate child, insofar as the devolution of his estate to his mother and through her to collateral kindred is concerned. This section provides, in effect, that as to all relationships except those arising from his father, the illegitimate's property is to be inherited as if he were legitimate. The doctrine of the common law that he has no inheritable blood has thus been abolished in this respect. That these sections have entirely changed the common law rules relating to the capacity of illegitimates to inherit and to transmit inheritance was expressly held in Estate of Wardell, 57 Cal. 484. In that case a testatrix died leaving surviving two legitimate sons, mentioned in the will, and an illegitimate daughter not mentioned in the will. The question presented was whether such illegitimate child was a pretermitted heir under the terms of section 1307 of the Civil Code (now substantially embodied in sec. 90 of the Probate Code). That section provided that \"when any testator omits to provide in his will for any of his children ... unless it appears that such omission was intentional, such child ... must have the same share of the estate of the testator as if he had died intestate. ...\" The contention was made that the terms \"children\" and \"child\" as used in this statute included only legitimate children, on the ground that at common law such terms referred only to legitimate children. The court, while conceding this to be true at common law, pointed out that illegitimates under the laws of this and other states have been made (p. 491) \"capable of inheriting and transmitting inheritance\". After referring to section 1387 of the Civil Code from which section 255 of the Probate Code was substantially copied, the court pointed out (p. 491) that: \"the State has regulated the inheritable capacity of all children illegitimate by birth\". In holding that an illegitimate was a child within the meaning of Civil Code section 1307 the court stated (p. 492): <span class=\"star-pagination\">*311</span></p>\n<p> \"The respondent was, therefore, though illegitimate by birth, endowed by the statute with inheritable blood. She possessed the same heritable rights as heir of her mother, as if born in lawful wedlock. (Rogers v. Weller, 5 Biss. 166 [Fed. Cas. No. 12,022]; Garland v. Harrison, 8 Leigh, (35 Va.) 368; Bennett v. Toler, 15 Gratt. (56 Va.) 588 [78 Am. Dec. 638].) As an heir of her mother, she differed nothing in law from the other children, so far as the rights of inheritance which had been conferred upon her by law. To the full extent of those rights she was entitled to all the privileges and immunities of heirship. If her mother had died intestate, her right to a distributive share of the estate would have been unquestionable. Dying testate, the legal relation between mother and daughter was not impaired or destroyed. The latter was still a legitimate heir, as much so as the children legitimate by birth, for the law made her and (sic) heir to the same extent 'as if she had been born in lawful wedlock.'\"</p>\n<p> \"It is not to be supposed that the law which attached to her person the rights and duties of inheritance, and endowed her with the capacity to exercise them, meant to leave her a bastard, under the disabilities of the common law, if the mother unintentionally omitted to make provision for her in her will. When placed by law in the state and condition of heir, and invested with the character and capacity of heir, all the rights, privileges, and legal consequences incident to that relation were tacitly conferred upon her.\"</p>\n<p> The same general reasoning applies here. Section 226 of the Probate Code, above quoted, provides that the property of the decedent here involved must go to his \"next of kin in equal degree.\" Appellants argue that the grandchildren of Elizabeth Suter, by Dick, who is the great grandmother of decedent, are not Paterson's next of kin because Paterson's grandmother, Anna Maria, was illegitimate. Stated another way, it is urged that the phrase \"next of kin\" must be interpreted to mean legitimate next of kin. This contention must be predicated on the theory that an illegitimate has no inheritable blood for the purpose of taking or transmitting property--the reason behind the common law rule already discussed. Under sections 255 and 256 of the Probate Code, supra, that doctrine has been abolished. When the reason for a rule ceases, the rule should <span class=\"star-pagination\">*312</span> cease. (Civ. Code, sec. 3510.) Next of kin simply means those upon whom, under the circumstances defined in section 226 of the Probate Code, the law has conferred the right to inherit the property of one who dies intestate. Under section 256 an illegitimate is endowed, for the purpose of transmission of his property, with the same inheritable blood as that of a legitimate, as therein limited. His own heirs, as therein limited, are the same as those of a legitimate. There can be no doubt that had Anna Maria, the illegitimate grandmother of decedent, been living at his death, and had Paterson left no issue, spouse, parent, brother, sister or descendant of a deceased brother or sister, that Anna Maria would have inherited her grandson's property under section 226. But the inheritable bloodstream does not end with her. Under the provisions of section 256 she, although illegitimate, has been endowed with inheritable blood as if she \"had been born in lawful wedlock\" and had survived her father. Without doubt, the great grandmother of Paterson, the mother of Anna Maria, Elizabeth Suter, would be the heir of Anna Maria. If Anna Maria had been legitimate it is obvious Elizabeth Suter would be the next of kin of Paterson had she survived under the circumstances set forth in section 226. Stated another way, the phrase \"next of kin\" in section 226, just as the term \"children\" in section 90 of the Probate Code, by reason of the provisions of section 256 must be interpreted to include those in the illegitimate line as well as in the legitimate line.</p>\n<p> [3] Appellant urges that section 256 applies only where the estate of an illegitimate is before the court. This contention is without merit. We are here dealing with the interpretation of the phrase \"next of kin\" in section 226. Section 256 is looked to simply to ascertain the degree to which the legislature has conferred inheritable blood on illegitimates. It must be held that by these various sections the legislature has seen fit to unite the family tree of the illegitimate with that of his mother.</p>\n<p> Apparently there is no case in this jurisdiction directly holding that the mother of an illegitimate, or her descendants, are next of kin and may thus inherit from the legitimate descendants of an illegitimate. The principle, however, has been applied in analogous situations. It has been directly held in the Estate of Magee, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></span>, that an illegitimate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*313</span> may act as a conduit for purposes of inheritance. This case refutes appellants' theory, and necessarily refutes the strict limited interpretation they seek to place on section 256. In the Magee case, Suez Magee died intestate. She was an illegitimate daughter of Susan Magee, who predeceased her. Susan Magee had another illegitimate daughter, the half sister of the deceased, named Elizabeth Magee, who also predeceased the decedent. Elizabeth left surviving a legitimate son, Albert Redmond. Albert, therefore, if he could properly use his illegitimate mother Elizabeth as a conduit for purposes of inheritance, was related to the decedent in the third degree. It was held that Albert inherited the estate as against the claims of others related to the decedent in the fourth degree entirely through legitimate ancestors. In other words, it was held that under our statutory law, the legitimate child of an illegitimate, through his grandmother and illegitimate mother, could inherit the estate of the illegitimate half sister of his mother. Although it is true that in this case the estate of an illegitimate was before the court, the importance of the case is that it holds that the illegitimate mother of Albert could be used as a conduit through which Albert could inherit. The reasoning by which this conclusion was reached is instructive in the present case. At page 415 it is stated:</p>\n<p> \"According to section 1388, Civil Code, if any illegitimate child (not acknowledged or adopted by his father) dies intestate, without lawful issue, his estate goes to his mother, or, in case of her decease, to her heirs at law. Suez Magee was illegitimate; she died intestate; Susan, her mother, had died before her; therefore, upon the death of Suez, the property of the latter was to go to the heirs of the mother, Susan. The next question, then, is who are the heirs of Susan? Section 1387, Civil Code, we think, answers the inquiry. Every illegitimate child is in all cases an heir of his mother, and inherits in the same manner as if born in lawful wedlock. There is no question as to the heirship of Albert E.; he is the legitimate son of his mother, Elizabeth. She (Elizabeth) was the illegitimate daughter of Susan. By section 1387, just referred to, Elizabeth was the heir of her mother, in the same manner as if born in lawful wedlock. If, then, Elizabeth had been born in lawful wedlock, she would unquestionably have been heir of her mother; being born out of wedlock, she is by the statute made heir of her mother in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*314</span> the same manner as if born in wedlock. Being, then, the heir of her mother, and dying leaving issue, the property of Suez goes to such issue; not because the issue is heir of Suez, but is heir of Susan.\"</p>\n<p> And again at page 416 it is stated:</p>\n<p> \"If Elizabeth had died intestate and without issue, doubtless the estate of Suez would have gone to the Cunninghams, as the heirs of Susan, the mother of Elizabeth and Suez; but as Albert E. is, through his mother, Elizabeth, the heir of Susan, he is entitled to the estate of Suez--not, perhaps, because he is the heir of Suez, but because he is the heir of the mother of Suez, and as such is, under the statute, entitled to take.\"</p>\n<p> Thus Estate of Magee, supra, holds that the son of an illegitimate mother may inherit through that mother the estate of a descendant of his maternal grandmother. That is the converse of the situation presented in the instant case. But the same reasoning applies. If the above premise is sound, and it has been reaffirmed in Estate of De Cigaran, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">682</span></span> [89 P. 833], and Estate of Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1303675\"><a href=\"/opinion/1303675/estate-of-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span> [42 PaCal.2d 1011], it would seem to follow that the estate of a descendant (Paterson) of an illegitimate (Anna Maria) may be inherited by the mother of the illegitimate (Elizabeth Suter) or her descendants (respondents). If the illegitimate can act as a conduit going in one direction it would seem to necessarily follow that she can act as a conduit going in the other direction. Any other conclusion would be extremely illogical. The real question in each situation is whether the common law rule depriving the illegitimate of inheritable blood has been changed in this state, so that an illegitimate can act as a conduit for purposes of inheritance. The Magee case holds that it has. The language in the Magee case concerning the limitation upon the inheritable blood of an illegitimate in section 255 of the Probate Code is not here applicable. There is no such comparable limitation in section 256 with which we are here concerned. If under section 255 as held in the Magee case, the illegitimate may act as a conduit from his mother to his children--if his children may inherit from his mother through him, it follows that by section 256 the illegitimate may act as a conduit from his descendants to his mother. If by section 255 his descendants are permitted to inherit through him from his mother, it must <span class=\"star-pagination\">*315</span> follow that by section 256 his mother may inherit from his descendants because by that section she is made his heir.</p>\n<p> To summarize: Clearly, Anna Maria was entitled to inherit from her legitimate descendants, and as such she, if living, would have been the next of kin of Paterson. This being so, section 256 operates in favor of Anna Maria's mother, Elizabeth Suter, and her descendants--respondents here.</p>\n<p> Appellants rely on three cases as establishing a contrary rule--Curtis v. Hewins, 52 Mass. (11 Metc.) 294, Hardesty v. Mitchell, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></span> [134 N.E. 745, 24 A.L.R. 565], and Sanford v. Marsh, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></span> [62 N.E. 268]. It must be conceded that these three cases interpreted statutes substantially similar to the ones here involved contrary to the interpretation here made. The Curtis case contains little or no discussion. The Hardesty case is predicated on the Sanford case. The underlying reasoning of the Sanford case is disclosed in the following quotation. At page 268 it is stated:</p>\n<p> \"The case before us is not within the language of the statute, for we are not dealing with the estate of an illegitimate child, but with the estate of the daughter of an illegitimate child, who had deceased before the daughter. The question is whether the statute shall be construed strictly, or whether we discover in it a purpose to place all persons claiming through an illegitimate relation in the same position as if there were no illegitimacy in reference to the distribution of the property of persons dying intestate who are descended from an illegitimate ancestor. By the common law a bastard is nullius filius. He can be the heir of no one, nor have heirs, except of his own body. He has no ancestors from whom any inheritable blood can be derived. The common law on this subject is in force in Massachusetts, except as it has been changed by the statutes. The statutes which have been adopted here have all been construed strictly. ... We see no good reason for departing from the rule that statutes of this kind are to be construed strictly.\"</p>\n<p> [4] This is not the rule of construction in this state. Section 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure now reads, and has so read since 1872, that:</p>\n<p> \"The rule of the common law, that statutes in derogation thereof are to be strictly construed, has no application to this code. The code establishes the law of this state respecting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*316</span> the subjects to which it relates, and its provisions and all proceedings under it are to be liberally construed, with a view to effect its objects and to promote justice.\"</p>\n<p> Section 2 of the Probate Code provides:</p>\n<p> \"The provisions of this code, so far as they are substantially the same as existing statutes, must be construed as continuations thereof, and not as new enactments.\"</p>\n<p> In the Magee case section 255 was given such liberal construction. We must give the same liberal construction to section 256. The Magee case is opposed in theory to the above three cases. The rule of the Magee case is followed generally (see Foster v. Lee, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ala.</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></span> [55 So. 125, Ann. Cas. 1913C, 1335]; Bales v.

Bauder for Respondents.</p>\n<p> The Court.</p>\n<p> In the evening of December 9, 1937, plaintiffs were passengers in a taxicab driven by defendant Nave and owned by defendant corporation, which collided with a Plymouth automobile driven by defendant La Force. They seek to recover damages for injuries received in the collision. Defendant Agnes Whelan was made a defendant under allegations that she was the owner of the Plymouth car. When both sides rested the trial court granted a motion for a directed verdict as to defendant Nave and the taxicab company. The jury returned verdicts in favor of defendant Whelan and against defendant La Force in the sums of $13,922.67 for plaintiff William Dieterle, $13,875.86 for plaintiff Charlotte Dieterle, $1556.17 for plaintiff Hagenbruch and $570 for plaintiff Zeisler. Plaintiffs have appealed from the judgments in favor of defendants Whelan, Nave and the taxicab company. The briefs contain no arguments as to the appeal from the judgment in favor of defendant Whelan and therefore it will not be discussed herein.</p>\n<p> [1] The power of the trial court to direct a verdict is limited and has been well defined. It may direct a verdict only when, disregarding conflicting evidence and giving plaintiffs' evidence all the value to which it is legally entitled, and indulging every legitimate inference which may be drawn therefrom, no evidence of sufficient substantiality to support a verdict in favor of plaintiffs, if given, may be found. (Mairo v. Yellow Cab Co., 208 Cal. 350 [281 P. 66].) Although the evidence was conflicting and would doubtless have supported a verdict in favor of Nave if the jury had rendered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*99</span> such a verdict upon proper instructions of the court, we must, nevertheless, in view of the nature of this appeal and in accordance with the rule above set forth, consider the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p> The accident occurred at about 8 o'clock in the evening at the intersection of Beverly Boulevard and Lucerne Street in the city of Los Angeles. A drizzling rain was falling and the surface of the street was wet. The night was dark but the street was lighted. Beverly Boulevard is what is known as a \"through street\". A stop sign had been placed at the intersection requiring cars approaching Beverly Boulevard from Lucerne Street to stop before entering the intersection. Defendant Nave was driving the taxicab in an easterly direction on Beverly Boulevard and defendant La Force was driving the Plymouth car in a northerly direction on Lucerne Street. The collision occurred in the southeasterly quarter of the intersection, about midway between the northerly and southerly lines of the quarter of the intersection and about six or eight feet from its easterly line. The taxicab was struck on its right rear side. Defendant La Force testified that he made a complete boulevard stop and as he was making the stop the taxicab was approximately 100 feet west of the westerly line of the intersection. Thereupon La Force, according to his testimony, proceeded in low gear into the intersection driving at from eight to ten miles per hour. While the Plymouth was standing still the taxicab traveled about forty feet and when the Plymouth was put in motion the taxicab was from fifty to sixty feet from the intersection. La Force estimated the speed at which the taxicab was travelling at from 30 to 35 miles per hour. Defendant Nave testified that when he approached the intersection at 20 miles per hour he slowed his car slightly for a \"dip\" and went straight across the intersection without applying his brakes; that his right window was down and that he could see the Plymouth car; that he did in fact keep his eyes upon the Plymouth car as he crossed the intersection except for a second; that the Plymouth car was back of the stop signal when he, Nave, was in the intersection. Other witnesses testified that the Plymouth car did not make the required boulevard stop.</p>\n<p> Plaintiffs contend that if the jury had been given the opportunity to pass upon the issues as to respondents and had believed the testimony which was most favorable to plaintiffs <span class=\"star-pagination\">*100</span> a finding that the taxicab was driven at an excessive and negligent speed would have been supported. They also contend that since testimony was received that the Plymouth car did not make the boulevard stop but \"came through very fast\", and since Nave testified that he observed the Plymouth as he approached and was crossing the intersection, a finding by the jury that he could have avoided the collision by the exercise of due caution would have been supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p> [2] Since the plaintiffs were being transported as passengers for a reward by respondents they could rely upon the obligation of the driver of the taxicab to use the utmost care and diligence for their safety. In presenting their case to the trial court they were entitled to the presumption embodied in the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. A case strikingly similar to the one under review is that of St. Clair v. McAlister, 216 Cal. 95 [13 PaCal.2d 924]. In that case the plaintiff was a passenger on a bus which stopped at a corner of an intersection and then proceeded slowly across the intersection. A Ford car driven across the intersection at an excessive rate of speed collided with the bus. The plaintiff sued both the driver of the Ford car and the owner of the bus. In affirming the judgment against both of the defendants Mr. Justice Shenk, speaking for the court and referring to the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, uses language which bears so clearly upon the case now before us that a quotation therefrom is especially appropriate: \"It was the duty of the carrier to exercise 'the utmost care and diligence for the safe carriage' of the plaintiff (sec. 2100, Civ. Code), and upon showing that she was a passenger and was injured while being carried as such, a presumption of negligence arose, as to which it was incumbent on the carrier to show that it was free from negligence. (Scarborough v. Urgo, 191 Cal. 341 [216 P. 584].) We have no hesitancy in saying that the plaintiff produced proof entitling her to invoke the doctrine contended for by her.\"</p>\n<p> \"The evidence offered by the defendant corporation to rebut the presumption consisted in the main in proving the negligence of the driver of the Ford car as to which all parties have agreed. As noted, the driver of the bus was not a witness and his employer offered no proof the effect of which would show that the driver could not have avoided the collision by the exercise of due caution. In the presence of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*101</span> presumption it cannot be said as a matter of law that the trial court erroneously applied the doctrine.\"</p>\n<p> \"But the defendant corporation insists that the evidence of the conduct in detail of the driver of the Ford car, and particularly that produced by the plaintiff removed the case from the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, and that such proof showed the collision to be due solely to the negligence of the driver of the Ford car. We cannot agree. The plaintiff was confronted with a situation where, in charging concurrent negligence, she was entitled to the application of the doctrine upon proof of her status as a passenger on the bus while the same was being operated by the bus company and the resultant injury from such operation. But as to McAlister, she was bound to prove his negligence by a preponderance of the evidence without the aid of the presumption. This she could not do except by proving the particular acts which constituted such negligence. By producing such proof it should not be held that she waived or forfeited her right to invoke the doctrine as to defendant's carrying her as a passenger.\"</p>\n<p> It will be noted that in the case from which quotation is made, as well as in our own case, the plaintiff offered proof showing in detail the circumstances of the collision. It is pointed out in the St. Clair case that defendant \"offered no proof the effect of which would show that the driver could not have avoided the collision by the exercise of due caution\". Although defendant Nave was sworn as a witness he did not claim that he applied his brakes or attempted to swerve the taxicab in order to avoid the collision.</p>\n<p> [3] The trial court in passing upon the motion for a directed verdict could not, and this court in reviewing the order of the trial court, cannot weigh the evidence for the purpose of determining wherein rests the preponderance of the evidence. That question ordinarily is one for the jury and may not be taken from the jury unless no substantial evidence be presented which, viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, would support a verdict in their favor. Plaintiffs were not bound by the testimony of La Force in toto nor were they bound by the testimony of Nave in toto. They had the right to depend upon the most favorable portions of the testimony of these and other witnesses together <span class=\"star-pagination\">*102</span> with all fair and reasonable inferences which could be deduced therefrom. The court erred in directing the verdict.</p>\n<p> The judgment as to defendant Agnes Whelan is affirmed.

Cornell for Appellants.</p>\n<p> Harry B. Ellison, J. L. Ronnow and Reginald I. Bauder for Respondents.</p>\n<p> The Court.</p>\n<p> In the evening of December 9, 1937, plaintiffs were passengers in a taxicab driven by defendant Nave and owned by defendant corporation, which collided with a Plymouth automobile driven by defendant La Force. They seek to recover damages for injuries received in the collision. Defendant Agnes Whelan was made a defendant under allegations that she was the owner of the Plymouth car. When both sides rested the trial court granted a motion for a directed verdict as to defendant Nave and the taxicab company. The jury returned verdicts in favor of defendant Whelan and against defendant La Force in the sums of $13,922.67 for plaintiff William Dieterle, $13,875.86 for plaintiff Charlotte Dieterle, $1556.17 for plaintiff Hagenbruch and $570 for plaintiff Zeisler. Plaintiffs have appealed from the judgments in favor of defendants Whelan, Nave and the taxicab company. The briefs contain no arguments as to the appeal from the judgment in favor of defendant Whelan and therefore it will not be discussed herein.</p>\n<p> [1] The power of the trial court to direct a verdict is limited and has been well defined. It may direct a verdict only when, disregarding conflicting evidence and giving plaintiffs' evidence all the value to which it is legally entitled, and indulging every legitimate inference which may be drawn therefrom, no evidence of sufficient substantiality to support a verdict in favor of plaintiffs, if given, may be found. (Mairo v. Yellow Cab Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></span> [281 P. 66].) Although the evidence was conflicting and would doubtless have supported a verdict in favor of Nave if the jury had rendered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*99</span> such a verdict upon proper instructions of the court, we must, nevertheless, in view of the nature of this appeal and in accordance with the rule above set forth, consider the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p> The accident occurred at about 8 o'clock in the evening at the intersection of Beverly Boulevard and Lucerne Street in the city of Los Angeles. A drizzling rain was falling and the surface of the street was wet. The night was dark but the street was lighted. Beverly Boulevard is what is known as a \"through street\". A stop sign had been placed at the intersection requiring cars approaching Beverly Boulevard from Lucerne Street to stop before entering the intersection. Defendant Nave was driving the taxicab in an easterly direction on Beverly Boulevard and defendant La Force was driving the Plymouth car in a northerly direction on Lucerne Street. The collision occurred in the southeasterly quarter of the intersection, about midway between the northerly and southerly lines of the quarter of the intersection and about six or eight feet from its easterly line. The taxicab was struck on its right rear side. Defendant La Force testified that he made a complete boulevard stop and as he was making the stop the taxicab was approximately 100 feet west of the westerly line of the intersection. Thereupon La Force, according to his testimony, proceeded in low gear into the intersection driving at from eight to ten miles per hour. While the Plymouth was standing still the taxicab traveled about forty feet and when the Plymouth was put in motion the taxicab was from fifty to sixty feet from the intersection. La Force estimated the speed at which the taxicab was travelling at from 30 to 35 miles per hour. Defendant Nave testified that when he approached the intersection at 20 miles per hour he slowed his car slightly for a \"dip\" and went straight across the intersection without applying his brakes; that his right window was down and that he could see the Plymouth car; that he did in fact keep his eyes upon the Plymouth car as he crossed the intersection except for a second; that the Plymouth car was back of the stop signal when he, Nave, was in the intersection. Other witnesses testified that the Plymouth car did not make the required boulevard stop.</p>\n<p> Plaintiffs contend that if the jury had been given the opportunity to pass upon the issues as to respondents and had believed the testimony which was most favorable to plaintiffs <span class=\"star-pagination\">*100</span> a finding that the taxicab was driven at an excessive and negligent speed would have been supported. They also contend that since testimony was received that the Plymouth car did not make the boulevard stop but \"came through very fast\", and since Nave testified that he observed the Plymouth as he approached and was crossing the intersection, a finding by the jury that he could have avoided the collision by the exercise of due caution would have been supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p> [2] Since the plaintiffs were being transported as passengers for a reward by respondents they could rely upon the obligation of the driver of the taxicab to use the utmost care and diligence for their safety. In presenting their case to the trial court they were entitled to the presumption embodied in the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. A case strikingly similar to the one under review is that of St. Clair v. McAlister, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></span> [13 PaCal.2d 924]. In that case the plaintiff was a passenger on a bus which stopped at a corner of an intersection and then proceeded slowly across the intersection. A Ford car driven across the intersection at an excessive rate of speed collided with the bus. The plaintiff sued both the driver of the Ford car and the owner of the bus. In affirming the judgment against both of the defendants Mr. Justice Shenk, speaking for the court and referring to the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, uses language which bears so clearly upon the case now before us that a quotation therefrom is especially appropriate: \"It was the duty of the carrier to exercise 'the utmost care and diligence for the safe carriage' of the plaintiff (sec. 2100, Civ. Code), and upon showing that she was a passenger and was injured while being carried as such, a presumption of negligence arose, as to which it was incumbent on the carrier to show that it was free from negligence. (Scarborough v. Urgo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></span> [216 P. 584].) We have no hesitancy in saying that the plaintiff produced proof entitling her to invoke the doctrine contended for by her.\"</p>\n<p> \"The evidence offered by the defendant corporation to rebut the presumption consisted in the main in proving the negligence of the driver of the Ford car as to which all parties have agreed. As noted, the driver of the bus was not a witness and his employer offered no proof the effect of which would show that the driver could not have avoided the collision by the exercise of due caution. In the presence of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*101</span> presumption it cannot be said as a matter of law that the trial court erroneously applied the doctrine.\"</p>\n<p> \"But the defendant corporation insists that the evidence of the conduct in detail of the driver of the Ford car, and particularly that produced by the plaintiff removed the case from the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, and that such proof showed the collision to be due solely to the negligence of the driver of the Ford car. We cannot agree. The plaintiff was confronted with a situation where, in charging concurrent negligence, she was entitled to the application of the doctrine upon proof of her status as a passenger on the bus while the same was being operated by the bus company and the resultant injury from such operation. But as to McAlister, she was bound to prove his negligence by a preponderance of the evidence without the aid of the presumption. This she could not do except by proving the particular acts which constituted such negligence. By producing such proof it should not be held that she waived or forfeited her right to invoke the doctrine as to defendant's carrying her as a passenger.\"</p>\n<p> It will be noted that in the case from which quotation is made, as well as in our own case, the plaintiff offered proof showing in detail the circumstances of the collision. It is pointed out in the St. Clair case that defendant \"offered no proof the effect of which would show that the driver could not have avoided the collision by the exercise of due caution\". Although defendant Nave was sworn as a witness he did not claim that he applied his brakes or attempted to swerve the taxicab in order to avoid the collision.</p>\n<p> [3] The trial court in passing upon the motion for a directed verdict could not, and this court in reviewing the order of the trial court, cannot weigh the evidence for the purpose of determining wherein rests the preponderance of the evidence. That question ordinarily is one for the jury and may not be taken from the jury unless no substantial evidence be presented which, viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, would support a verdict in their favor. Plaintiffs were not bound by the testimony of La Force in toto nor were they bound by the testimony of Nave in toto. They had the right to depend upon the most favorable portions of the testimony of these and other witnesses together <span class=\"star-pagination\">*102</span> with all fair and reasonable inferences which could be deduced therefrom. The court erred in directing the verdict.</p>\n<p> The judgment as to defendant Agnes Whelan is affirmed. The judgment as to defendants Nave and Yellow Cab Company is reversed.</p>\n</div>","extracted_by_ocr":false,"opinions_cited":[]},{"resource_uri":"https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1111662/","absolute_url":"/opinion/1111662/martin-v-vierra/","cluster":"https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/1111662/","author":null,"joined_by":[],"date_created":"2013-10-30T04:06:09.466457Z","date_modified":"2016-02-29T01:44:09.388657Z","type":"010combined","sha1":"39c98c3cf7582bcc23c3d18cb359fe52cf35b3ba","download_url":null,"local_path":null,"plain_text":"","html":"","html_lawbox":"<div>\n<center><b>34 Cal.App.2d 86 (1939)</b></center>\n<center><h1>DOLORES MARTIN, Respondent,<br>\nv.<br>\nJOE VIERRA, Appellant.</h1></center>\n<center>Civ.

At the trial the cause was submitted to the determination of a jury on three issues of fact, namely, negligence of defendant, negligence of plaintiff, and the last clear chance; and a verdict was rendered in favor of plaintiff for the sum of $2,500. From the judgment entered thereon the defendant appeals. Summarized, the grounds urged for reversal are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*89</span> that the trial court erred in refusing to grant defendant's motion for a directed verdict; that there was a want of evidence to justify the submission to the jury of the issue of the last clear chance; and that the jury was erroneously instructed. We are satisfied that no prejudicial error has been shown.</p>\n<p> [1] The law governing the right of a trial court to grant a motion for directed verdict is well settled. As said in the Estate of Lances, 216 Cal. 397 [14 PaCal.2d 768], wherein numerous earlier cases are cited, such a motion may be granted only when, disregarding conflicting evidence and giving to plaintiff's evidence all the value to which it is legally entitled, herein indulging in every legitimate inference which may be drawn from that evidence, the result is a determination that there is no evidence of sufficient substantiality to support a verdict in favor of the plaintiff if such a verdict were given; that therefore unless it can be said as a matter of law that, when so considered, no other reasonable conclusion is legally deducible from the evidence, and that any other holding would be so lacking in evidentiary support that a reviewing court would be impelled to reverse it upon appeal, or the trial court to set it aside as a matter of law, the trial court is not justified in taking the case from the jury. Continuing, the court points out that such a motion is in the nature of a demurrer to the evidence, is governed by practically the same rules, and concedes as true the evidence on behalf of the adverse party, with all fair and reasonable inferences to be deduced therefrom; that in the determination of such a motion the trial court is controlled by rules entirely different from those governing in the matter of granting a new trial; that on motion for a new trial, the trial court may weigh the evidence and judge of the credibility of the witnesses, whereas on a motion for a directed verdict, it may not do so, its power in passing upon such motion being strictly limited; that therefore, while the state of the evidence may be such as would warrant the trial court in granting a new trial, it would not be justified in directing a verdict on the same evidence. In other words, says the court, the function of the trial court on motion for directed verdict is analogous to and practically the same as that of a reviewing court in determining on appeal whether there is any evidence in the record of sufficient substance to support a verdict. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span></p>\n<p> [2] Measured by the foregoing rules, it is apparent that the evidence here falls far short of being such as would have warranted the trial court in granting a motion for a directed verdict, for the reason that it was conflicting on material points, and the facts and circumstances adduced in support of plaintiff's case were amply sufficient to justify a verdict against the defendant on any one or all of the following grounds: driving his automobile at a speed greater than was reasonable and prudent, having regard to the traffic and so as to endanger the safety of persons crossing the street; operating the same with defective brakes; and failure to exercise due care to avoid colliding with plaintiff after having observed her in the street in a position of peril. In other words, it affirmatively appears from the evidence that when defendant first saw plaintiff she was in the street fifty feet or more distant from him; that he observed she was an elderly woman, and was attempting to cross the street, that he gave no warning of his approach, and although he applied his brakes at a point some thirty-three feet distant from the point of collision, plaintiff was hurled twelve feet by the force of the impact, and the automobile was not brought to a stop until it reached the curb about twenty-three feet beyond the point of collision.</p>\n<p> [3] Defendant's contention that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law is based upon the fact that the city maintained an ordinance requiring pedestrians while crossing the streets in the business section to keep within lanes marked by white lines, and certain testimony introduced in behalf of defendant to the effect that plaintiff was attempting to cross the intersection outside of the pedestrian lanes. On the other hand, there are ample circumstances disclosed by the evidence which reasonably support the claim made in behalf of plaintiff that she was actually within the pedestrian lane when she was struck. In any event, the situation presented by the evidence was such as to justify the conclusion that after defendant observed plaintiff in the street in a position of peril of which she was obviously unaware, he had the last clear chance to avoid colliding with her by diverting the course of his automobile to the left, which he readily could have done if he had been driving prudently and with due care, instead of swerving to the right. He claimed that if he had adopted the former course <span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> he would have collided with a truck; but there is testimony in the record showing that the location of the truck would not have interfered with such movement. It is quite evident, therefore, that in the foregoing state of the evidence the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a directed verdict, and submitted the cause to the determination of the jury on the issues of fact above mentioned.</p>\n<p> [4] With respect to the instructions, complaint is made first of a group given at plaintiff's request pertaining to the doctrine of the last clear chance, the chief criticism made being that certain elements of the doctrine were omitted therefrom. The rule is, however, that all instructions given must on appeal be taken and considered as a whole; and here the record shows that in addition to those challenged the court gave others proposed by the defendant wherein all of the elements of said doctrine were clearly and correctly stated. Therefore, when the latter are read in connection with those criticized, it becomes apparent that the law bearing upon the subject of the last clear chance was fully and fairly presented to the jury.</p>\n<p> [5] The next objection goes to instruction No. 7 proposed by plaintiff, to the effect that plaintiff had the right to cross the street at any point and was chargeable in so doing only with the exercise of due cure. On account of the existing city ordinance requiring pedestrians while crossing the streets in the business district to keep within lanes marked for such purposes, it is evident that said instruction was inapplicable to the facts of this case and therefore should not have been given. It appears, however, that later in its charge the court gave another instruction proposed by the defendant wherein the law upon the subject was clearly and correctly stated. This latter instruction is numbered 49, and is as follows: \"In addition to the general rule of ordinary care which applies to the conduct of all parties using the streets, a traffic ordinance of the city of Santa Clara, in full force and effect at the time this accident occurred, provided as follows: Section 10. Pedestrian's Limited Right to Use of Roadway. When within the business district, no pedestrian shall cross a roadway other than by a crosswalk. ... It shall be unlawful for any person to be in any roadway other than a safety zone or crosswalk, provided that this provision shall not be construed to prevent the necessary use of a roadway by a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> pedestrian. ... The court instructs you that a violation of the foregoing ordinance by the plaintiff would be negligence as a matter of law on her part, unless such violation was excused. The court further instructs you that the place where this accident occurred was within a business district, and therefore it was a violation of the ordinance for the plaintiff to cross at any other place than within a crosswalk.\" Moreover, the record shows that after the jury retired to deliberate and before it reached a verdict it returned into court at its own request, called the court's attention to the apparent conflict between the two instructions so given, and asked that the matter be clarified; whereupon after some discussion the court re-read defendant's instruction No. 49 (the correct one) and omitted entirely any reference to instruction No. 7 (the inapplicable one); and following the reading of the correct instruction it re-read also at the request of the foreman of the jury another instruction proposed by defendant to the effect that the slightest degree of contributory negligence on plaintiff's part barred her recovery, no matter how negligent defendant may have been. Thereupon the jury again retired to deliberate, and subsequently returned its verdict in favor of plaintiff. The governing rule is that the giving of conflicting instructions does not serve as ground for reversal where it appears that the jury was not misled thereby (2 Cal.Jur., p. 1027; 1 Cal.Jur. Ten-Year Supp., p. 646); and manifestly this is such a case, for as will be seen from the foregoing, the jury itself noted the conflict before it reached an agreement on the merits, and upon returning into court it was not only correctly instructed on the doubtful point but as shown by the record the confusion which had theretofore apparently arisen by reason of the conflict was clarified to the satisfaction of the jury before it again retired to deliberate upon its verdict. As held in the following cases, the determination of the question of whether a jury has been misled by conflicting instructions must depend necessarily upon the circumstances of each particular case (Barkaus v. Producers Fruit Co., 192 Cal. 200 [219 P. 435]; Pittam v. City of Riverside, 128 Cal.App. 57 [16 PaCal.2d 768]); and here the proceedings had following the return of the jury into court for the very purpose of being advised as to which of the two instructions properly declared the law show beyond doubt that the jury fully understood before it reached <span class=\"star-pagination\">*93</span> its verdict that instruction No. 49 as re-read to them was controlling.</p>\n<p> [6] Also without merit are the objections made to instructions No. 9, No. 15 and No. 16 regarding the amount of care required of an automobilist and a pedestrian respectively. (Weihe v. Rathjen Mercantile Co., 34 Cal.App. 302 [167 P. 287].) Indeed, quite contrary to the contentions made by defendant in this behalf, it is held to be error to refuse instructions in the form here challenged (Dawson v. Lalanne, 22 Cal.App.2d 314 [70 PaCal.2d 1002]; Broun v. Blair, 26 Cal.App.2d 613 [80 PaCal.2d 95]; Vedder v. Bireley, 92 Cal.App. 52 [267 P. 724]; Pinello v. Taylor, 128 Cal. 508 [17 PaCal.2d 1039]); and in Dawson v. Lalanne, supra, the refusal was held to be reversible error. Nor may the verdict be set aside because of the incidental reference in one of said instructions to an automobile as a dangerous instrumentality capable of inflicting severe injuries. (Del Carlo v. Oberti, 2 Cal.App.2d 304 [37 PaCal.2d 1050].) In Warnke v. Griffith Co., 133 Cal.App. 481 [24 PaCal.2d 583], relied on by defendant, the trial court refused to give an instruction embodying among other matters the principle of law here questioned, and such refusal was upheld on appeal; not, however, upon the ground, as defendant argues, that such was not the law, but because the requested instruction was \"very long\" and involved, and the other legal matters incorporated therein would have had the effect of confusing the jury. In fact the soundness of the principle of law here objected to was there expressly recognized, the court in this behalf saying: \"... and while it is undoubtedly true that the amount of care required of the driver of the truck was greater than that required of appellant, as set forth in the part of the instruction refused by the court, and while such instruction sets forth a correct principle of law, we are of the opinion that the charges given by the court are equally sound as principles of law.\"</p>\n<p> [7] Defendant's final point is directed against instruction No. 20, bearing upon the issue of contributory negligence and having particular reference to the standard to be used in measuring the degree of care to be exercised by persons \"mentally deficient by reason of old age\". As authority for the instruction plaintiff cites the statement of law set forth in section 40, 19 California Jurisprudence at page 603, which is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*94</span> founded on certain portions of the opinion rendered in Giraudi v. Electric Imp. Co., 107 Cal. 120 [40 P. 108, 48 Am.St.Rep. 114, 28 L.R.A. 596]; and it is quite apparent that the theory upon which the instruction is based finds support in the general language used in said opinion, as well as in the quotation therein from Shearman and Redfield on Negligence (sec. 87). However, assuming that the instruction in the form here presented and given deviated somewhat from the precise standard of conduct contended for by defendant, it cannot be said that the giving of this single instruction had the prejudicial effect claimed by defendant, for as said in the following cases, \"in determining whether a jury has been properly instructed as to the law, the instructions taken as a whole must be considered; ... and questionable instructions are not ground form reversal where the rights of appellant are clearly stated to the jury in other instructions\" (American Marine Paint Co. v. Nyno Line, Inc., 70 Cal.App. 415 [233 P. 366]; Anderson v. Southern Pac. Co., 129 Cal.App. 206 [18 PaCal.2d 703]); and here not only was the jury instructed in several instances throughout the court's charge in accordance with defendant's views, but the court gave also an instruction proposed by the defendant which in terms and substance was extremely favorable to defendant, to the effect that if the jury found that plaintiff \"by reason of physical infirmity or old age was more apt to have difficulty in going about the public streets, then ordinary care on her part would require her to use more care for her own protection ... than would be required of one who is not so apt to be injured or fall by reason of such infirmity ...\" Moreover and in any event, the question of the precise correctness of instruction No. 20 is not vital in the present case because as stated the evidence was amply sufficient to justify the jury in finding against the defendant under the doctrine of the last clear chance, which, as shown by defendant's instruction No. 46, can be applied only after finding that the plaintiff has in fact been negligent. [8] In this connection attention may be properly called to the general rule of law that \"where several issues in a cause are tried and submitted to a jury for its determination, a general verdict may not be disturbed for uncertainty, if one issue is sustained by the evidence and is unaffected by error.\" (Hume v. Fresno Irr. Dist., 21 Cal.App.2d 348 [69 PaCal.2d 483].) And <span class=\"star-pagination\">*95</span> reference may be made also to the constitutional inhibition that no judgment shall be set aside or new trial granted in any case, on the ground of misdirection of the jury, unless after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence, the court should be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. (Art. VI, sec. 4 1/2, Const. Cal.) In the present case there is no reasonable ground upon which it may be so held.</p>\n<p> The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p> Peters, P. J., and Ward, J., concurred.</p>\n<p> A petition by appellant to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court was denied on October 9, 1939, and the following opinion was then rendered:</p>\n<p> The Court.</p>\n<p> The petition for hearing is denied. However, we expressly withhold our approval of the following statement in paragraph four of the opinion of the District Court of Appeal concerning the rule of last clear chance: \"In any event, the situation presented by the evidence was such as to justify the conclusion that after defendant observed plaintiff in the street in a position of peril of which she was obviously unaware, he had the last clear chance to avoid colliding with her by diverting the course of his automobile to the left, which he readily could have done if he had been driving prudently and with due care, instead of swerving to the right.\"</p>\n</div>","html_columbia":null,"html_with_citations":"<div>\n<center><b><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

He claimed that if he had adopted the former course <span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> he would have collided with a truck; but there is testimony in the record showing that the location of the truck would not have interfered with such movement. It is quite evident, therefore, that in the foregoing state of the evidence the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a directed verdict, and submitted the cause to the determination of the jury on the issues of fact above mentioned.</p>\n<p> [4] With respect to the instructions, complaint is made first of a group given at plaintiff's request pertaining to the doctrine of the last clear chance, the chief criticism made being that certain elements of the doctrine were omitted therefrom. The rule is, however, that all instructions given must on appeal be taken and considered as a whole; and here the record shows that in addition to those challenged the court gave others proposed by the defendant wherein all of the elements of said doctrine were clearly and correctly stated. Therefore, when the latter are read in connection with those criticized, it becomes apparent that the law bearing upon the subject of the last clear chance was fully and fairly presented to the jury.</p>\n<p> [5] The next objection goes to instruction No. 7 proposed by plaintiff, to the effect that plaintiff had the right to cross the street at any point and was chargeable in so doing only with the exercise of due cure. On account of the existing city ordinance requiring pedestrians while crossing the streets in the business district to keep within lanes marked for such purposes, it is evident that said instruction was inapplicable to the facts of this case and therefore should not have been given. It appears, however, that later in its charge the court gave another instruction proposed by the defendant wherein the law upon the subject was clearly and correctly stated. This latter instruction is numbered 49, and is as follows: \"In addition to the general rule of ordinary care which applies to the conduct of all parties using the streets, a traffic ordinance of the city of Santa Clara, in full force and effect at the time this accident occurred, provided as follows: Section 10. Pedestrian's Limited Right to Use of Roadway. When within the business district, no pedestrian shall cross a roadway other than by a crosswalk. ... It shall be unlawful for any person to be in any roadway other than a safety zone or crosswalk, provided that this provision shall not be construed to prevent the necessary use of a roadway by a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> pedestrian. ... The court instructs you that a violation of the foregoing ordinance by the plaintiff would be negligence as a matter of law on her part, unless such violation was excused. The court further instructs you that the place where this accident occurred was within a business district, and therefore it was a violation of the ordinance for the plaintiff to cross at any other place than within a crosswalk.\" Moreover, the record shows that after the jury retired to deliberate and before it reached a verdict it returned into court at its own request, called the court's attention to the apparent conflict between the two instructions so given, and asked that the matter be clarified; whereupon after some discussion the court re-read defendant's instruction No. 49 (the correct one) and omitted entirely any reference to instruction No. 7 (the inapplicable one); and following the reading of the correct instruction it re-read also at the request of the foreman of the jury another instruction proposed by defendant to the effect that the slightest degree of contributory negligence on plaintiff's part barred her recovery, no matter how negligent defendant may have been. Thereupon the jury again retired to deliberate, and subsequently returned its verdict in favor of plaintiff. The governing rule is that the giving of conflicting instructions does not serve as ground for reversal where it appears that the jury was not misled thereby (2 Cal.Jur., p. 1027; 1 Cal.Jur. Ten-Year Supp., p. 646); and manifestly this is such a case, for as will be seen from the foregoing, the jury itself noted the conflict before it reached an agreement on the merits, and upon returning into court it was not only correctly instructed on the doubtful point but as shown by the record the confusion which had theretofore apparently arisen by reason of the conflict was clarified to the satisfaction of the jury before it again retired to deliberate upon its verdict. As held in the following cases, the determination of the question of whether a jury has been misled by conflicting instructions must depend necessarily upon the circumstances of each particular case (Barkaus v. Producers Fruit Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></span> [219 P. 435]; Pittam v. City of Riverside, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></span> [16 PaCal.2d 768]); and here the proceedings had following the return of the jury into court for the very purpose of being advised as to which of the two instructions properly declared the law show beyond doubt that the jury fully understood before it reached <span class=\"star-pagination\">*93</span> its verdict that instruction No. 49 as re-read to them was controlling.</p>\n<p> [6] Also without merit are the objections made to instructions No. 9, No. 15 and No. 16 regarding the amount of care required of an automobilist and a pedestrian respectively. (Weihe v. Rathjen Mercantile Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></span> [167 P. 287].) Indeed, quite contrary to the contentions made by defendant in this behalf, it is held to be error to refuse instructions in the form here challenged (Dawson v. Lalanne, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1308796\"><a href=\"/opinion/1308796/dawson-v-lalanne/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Taylor, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></span> [17 PaCal.2d 1039]); and in Dawson v. Lalanne, supra, the refusal was held to be reversible error. Nor may the verdict be set aside because of the incidental reference in one of said instructions to an automobile as a dangerous instrumentality capable of inflicting severe injuries. (Del Carlo v. Oberti, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1185488\"><a href=\"/opinion/1185488/del-carlo-v-oberti/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span> [37 PaCal.2d 1050].) In Warnke v. Griffith Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></span> [24 PaCal.2d 583], relied on by defendant, the trial court refused to give an instruction embodying among other matters the principle of law here questioned, and such refusal was upheld on appeal; not, however, upon the ground, as defendant argues, that such was not the law, but because the requested instruction was \"very long\" and involved, and the other legal matters incorporated therein would have had the effect of confusing the jury. In fact the soundness of the principle of law here objected to was there expressly recognized, the court in this behalf saying: \"... and while it is undoubtedly true that the amount of care required of the driver of the truck was greater than that required of appellant, as set forth in the part of the instruction refused by the court, and while such instruction sets forth a correct principle of law, we are of the opinion that the charges given by the court are equally sound as principles of law.\"</p>\n<p> [7] Defendant's final point is directed against instruction No. 20, bearing upon the issue of contributory negligence and having particular reference to the standard to be used in measuring the degree of care to be exercised by persons \"mentally deficient by reason of old age\". As authority for the instruction plaintiff cites the statement of law set forth in section 40, 19 California Jurisprudence at page 603, which is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*94</span> founded on certain portions of the opinion rendered in Giraudi v. Electric Imp. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></span> [40 P. 108, 48 Am.St.Rep. 114, 28 L.R.A. 596]; and it is quite apparent that the theory upon which the instruction is based finds support in the general language used in said opinion, as well as in the quotation therein from Shearman and Redfield on Negligence (sec. 87). However, assuming that the instruction in the form here presented and given deviated somewhat from the precise standard of conduct contended for by defendant, it cannot be said that the giving of this single instruction had the prejudicial effect claimed by defendant, for as said in the following cases, \"in determining whether a jury has been properly instructed as to the law, the instructions taken as a whole must be considered; ... and questionable instructions are not ground form reversal where the rights of appellant are clearly stated to the jury in other instructions\" (American Marine Paint Co. v. Nyno Line, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></span> [233 P. 366]; Anderson v. Southern Pac. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></span> [18 PaCal.2d 703]); and here not only was the jury instructed in several instances throughout the court's charge in accordance with defendant's views, but the court gave also an instruction proposed by the defendant which in terms and substance was extremely favorable to defendant, to the effect that if the jury found that plaintiff \"by reason of physical infirmity or old age was more apt to have difficulty in going about the public streets, then ordinary care on her part would require her to use more care for her own protection ... than would be required of one who is not so apt to be injured or fall by reason of such infirmity ...\" Moreover and in any event, the question of the precise correctness of instruction No. 20 is not vital in the present case because as stated the evidence was amply sufficient to justify the jury in finding against the defendant under the doctrine of the last clear chance, which, as shown by defendant's instruction No. 46, can be applied only after finding that the plaintiff has in fact been negligent. [8] In this connection attention may be properly called to the general rule of law that \"where several issues in a cause are tried and submitted to a jury for its determination, a general verdict may not be disturbed for uncertainty, if one issue is sustained by the evidence and is unaffected by error.\" (Hume v. Fresno Irr. Dist., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></span> [69 PaCal.2d 483].) And <span class=\"star-pagination\">*95</span> reference may be made also to the constitutional inhibition that no judgment shall be set aside or new trial granted in any case, on the ground of misdirection of the jury, unless after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence, the court should be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. (Art. VI, sec. 4 1/2, Const. Cal.) In the present case there is no reasonable ground upon which it may be so held.</p>\n<p> The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p> Peters, P. J., and Ward, J., concurred.</p>\n<p> A petition by appellant to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court was denied on October 9, 1939, and the following opinion was then rendered:</p>\n<p> The Court.</p>\n<p> The petition for hearing is denied. However, we expressly withhold our approval of the following statement in paragraph four of the opinion of the District Court of Appeal concerning the rule of last clear chance: \"In any event, the situation presented by the evidence was such as to justify the conclusion that after defendant observed plaintiff in the street in a position of peril of which she was obviously unaware, he had the last clear chance to avoid colliding with her by diverting the course of his automobile to the left, which he readily could have done if he had been driving prudently and with due care, instead of swerving to the right.\"</p>\n</div>","extracted_by_ocr":false,"opinions_cited":["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1185488/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1308796/","https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1417537/"]}]}
